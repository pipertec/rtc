This new version includes a number\nof additions and improvements that help make your work faster and more accurate.\nThe \"What's New\" visualizer (link at top left corner of page) demonstrates many of the\nadditions and enhancements. Below is a description of some of the new features, with\nlinks to pages with details and examples. There are new visualizers for many of the\nfeatures, to help you become acquainted with them. To view them, click the visualizer\nlink at the end of the description. For a list of the new visualizers, go to\nSupport/Visualizer topics and press F2.\nThe system for displaying user interface elements, including menus, dialogs,\ncontrols, etc., have all been modified to enable correct display and interaction\naccording to Windows 11 standards. This includes a complete overhaul of the icons\nsystem, which now draws high-resolution vector-based icons for all commands which\nappear on the toolbars, menu items, dialogs and the Info bar AutoMagic choices.\nThese icons are largely constructed using the Segoe Fluent UI font created by\nMicrosoft as a universal standard for application icons, with a few additional\ncustomizations specific to Eclipse. The custom version of the TrueType font can be\nfound in the Eclipse installation folder as EclipseIcont.ttf. These icons are also usable\nin the new plugin system for creating custom commands.\nPython plugin system added. The Python programming language plugin\nsystem has been added to Eclipse 11. This is found under Support/Plugins and\ncontains various functions for editing and creating plugins. Plugins can be used as\nsimply as downloading a single file, or can be large and complex systems requiring a\nspecial installer. Long-term plans include streamlining systems for third parties to\ncontribute plugins, and for plugins to be available in an on-line repository for ease of\nsearching, downloading and installing. The full documentation for creating plugins is\nan entirely separate document, and can be as simple as creating a macro, or as\ncomplex as learning a coding language. Python is a full coding language, with\nthousands of open-source and commercial modules available for professional\ndevelopers and hobbyists, making this a virtually unlimited feature.\nAudio Features - Windows Audio Capture has been added. This allows users to capture\naudio being played through Windows and record it directly in Eclipse without the use of 3rd part\napplications like Voicemeeter. Additionally an Import button has been added to the Audio Control Panel\nthat allows the quick and easy import of audio files. Improvements to the audio dialog and safeguards\nagainst selecting the wrong compression for Boost and Boost Flow have been added. File not found\nerrors based on missing audio files will now specify the channel the system is looking for for additional\nuser context.\n641\n659\nWhat's New in Version 11 27\nConnection Magic - The server has undergone a complete rewrite to provide\nbetter and more stable performance, and to allow the implementation of new features\nin the future.\nBoost - This feature, found under User settings/Translation/Translation\nMagic, sends your audio to Google Speech or Speecmatics for help translating\ndifficult vocabulary like unusual names or fast speaking, picking up words that may\nhave been dropped, and suggesting realtime auto-briefs. It can be used during\nTranslation or Realtime but you will need a good audio recording plus internet access\nif using Google Speech. Boost has been improved in Eclipse 11 with improved conflict\nhandling and expanded options for exceptions.\nBoost Flow - A new feature that allows you to choose text as it's being\nprocessed by the speech engine. Use your steno machine or voice to select any\nnumber of words, or everything that has been suggested by the speech engine. Use\nsteno or voice utterances to accept and reject as much or as little text as you'd like,\nand write anything you prefer to write.\nEditing Statistics have been added. Found in Windows/View Toggles This\noptional visual indicator tracks your progress and time when editing a document.\nEdit Mode - Edit from your writer or with your voice with this incredible\nfeature. Combine with Boost Flow to write as much or as little as you desire and edit\nalong with the audio interpreation. Take over writing whenever necessary.\nFor details on all changes in this version, go to the Support menu in Eclipse and\nselect New version changes. A pdf file will open, describing in detail all the changes\nin Version 10.\nAll the new Visualizers topics are listed below, and links can be found here .\n532\n285\n292\n342\n425\n1280\n28 Eclipse Help\nNEW VISUALIZERS IN ECLIPSE 11:\nvL2 What's New in Eclipse 11\nvG5 Realtime Editing Kit V2\nvG5 Eclipse 11 Macro Update\nvG5a EditMode for Steno and Voice\nvD2b Boost Setup Update Eclipse 11\nvD2c Boost Edit\n2.1 Outline of Changes in Version 11\nOutline of Changes in Version 11\nPLUGINS\nPlugins included in this release candidate\nUSER INTERFACE\nWindows 11 overhaul\nWhat's New in Version 11 29\nScalability adjustments\nEditor notebar display options added\nAdd \"Google Search\" option to \"Marked block\" context menu\nPage format dropdown templates\nSpecial entries drop-list in the globaling dialog should list macros\nEditing progress timer with milestones/deadlines/pacing\nEDITMODE\nStatus bar shows EDIT mode indicator\nEdit Mode Macros\nEditmode dictionary\nEditmode conflict selection\nEditmode number conversion.\nInserting prefixes and suffixes with editmode\nDictionary syntax that doesn't make sense for editmode (such as literal text commands) will be\nignored\nGlobaling\nEdit Mode Best Practices\nRETRO BOOST IMPROVEMENTS\nGive \"Boost\" feature set its own dialog\nMinor table additions:\nBoost demo windows\nBoost Conflict handling changes\nAdjust title processing so that Boost can tell the difference between abbreviations and words at the\nend of a sentence.\nBoost including punctuation from Google\nBoost Auto-brief entry comments\nMajor Exceptions list expansion\nBOOST FLOW\nTRANSLATION\nTime delay feature for output (captioning)\nAllow text background colors in CART window\nAllow 'Force margins' for singular ANSI outputs\nWebVTT export added\nAUTO-BRIEF\nBrief reminders in editing should also draw from last Autobrief.dix and expert dictionaries\nTheory hints should allow multiple simultaneous hints from different sources\nAI Boost Auto-brief entry comments\nRecall/Reset mechanism for Autobriefs pop-up location data\nMake Autobrief pop-up window always visible in realtime\nADMINISTRATION\nLoad Users consolidation and hierarchy based on underscores in user.ini\nSeparation of old versions\nConversion warning for note files\n\"Eject\" button added to file manager for USB and other removable drives\nSupport Job Variables in \"Job Manager Options\">\"E-mail Body text\"\nDamaged Settings prompt/Revert mechanism\nEDITING\nEditing progress timer with milestones/deadlines/pacing\nOptionally load/store job variables in job dictionary\nAbility to use wildcards within \"Find steno\" dialog â \"Find/Replace\"\nAdd Flesch readability score to document statistics\nTeam Editing: Timestamps/user location in Chat log\nShow total strokes in job on job report\nADUIO\nWindows Audio Capture\n\"New audio file\" menu item\n30 Eclipse Help\nAdd/Delete buttons now auto-populate more helpfully\nModify record/levels button to go straight to microphones\nEnsure Opus or PCM 16/16 for AI Boost\nMove cursor function now works for Opus\nAudio Selection and Playback: \"file not found\" error-specific prompt should show the channel\nnumber\nPRODUCTION\nSupport for highlights with text in PDF Proofreading\nAbility to paginate with letters (1=a, 2=b, 3=c) etc\nEclipse Documentation 31\n3 Eclipse Documentation\nEclipse Documentation\nSupport/Eclipse documentation\nThe Eclipse Documentation item in the Support menu opens the\nDocumentation folder.\n32 Eclipse Help\nThis folder contains many documents pertaining to specific aspects of the Eclipse\nsoftware, such as:\nÂ· Eclipse Users Manual.pdf -- the complete manual.\nÂ· Eclipse Commands.pdf and Eclipse Hyperkeys.pdf -- printable keyboard\ncharts.\nÂ· AccuCap.pdf -- AccuCap addendum to the manual.\nÂ· The Visualizers folder is located here. If it is not, contact support at ASI for help\nreinstalling it.\nThere are also white papers on specific topics, such as automatic indexing; audio\nsynchronization; file management; multi-page printing; realtime editing; and other\ntasks.\nAll files in the Documentation folder are PDF files, except eclipse.chm, which is\nthe Help system. (Do not move, change, or delete this file. If you do, you will no\nlonger have access to Eclipse Help.) Note: Acrobat Reader needs to be on your\ncomputer in order for you to read the documentation files. If you do not\nalready have Acrobat Reader, you can install it from your Eclipse software\ninstallation CD.\nUsing Visualizers 33\n4 Using Visualizers\nUsing Visualizers\nThe Visualizer movies are brief audio/video presentations that demonstrate an\naspect of the Eclipse software. There are links in related topics in the help system;\nyou can also view a menu of them by selecting Visualizer Topics from the Support\nmenu in Eclipse or by going to this help topic . When you open the Visualizer\ndialog, you can choose to view and alphabetical list of movies, or see \"What's New\" in\nthe latest release, or get instruction on how to use the Visualizer presentations. There\nare also links to additional resources.\nTo play a visualizer file, left-click the Visualize icon that appears at the top right\nof any help topic that links to one movie. After a moment the presentation will begin.\nIf there are more than one visualizer that apply to the topic, clicking the icon will take\nyou to a list of them. These movies are independent .mp4 files; there is no extra\nsoftware to install.\n914\n34 Eclipse Help\nIf you have any difficulty playing the Visualizer movies, please call ASI support\nat 1-772-288-3266. Different versions of Windows combined with various default\nvideo players occasionally create problems when playing the visualizers. Support can\nhelp you find a combination that works for you. The visualizers are the best tool you\nhave available for seeing just how Eclipse works.\nGetting Started 35\n5 Getting Started\nGetting Started\nThis section covers:\nÂ· The process of installing Eclipse on your computer. (Instructions\nare also packaged with the DVD.)\nÂ· Activating your license\n5.1 Installation of Eclipse\nInstalling Eclipse\n1. Go to www.eclipseCAT.com\n2. Log in\n3. Navigate to Support Downloads Eclipse/AccuCap\n4. Click to download the EclipseSetup.exe\na. Choose from a Full Install option that includes all program\nelements and can be saved and used for future installs and an\nExpress Installer which requires internet access while installing\nEclipse.\n5. Choose save if prompted to save or open the file\n6. Once the download is complete double-click on the file to run it.\n7. If you install using the full installer, you have the option to omit the\nvisualizer installation if desired\nNetwork Installation: See Network Installation in the Reference Guide.\n5.2 Old Versions of Eclipse\nUsing Old Versions of Eclipse\nWhen you install Eclipse 11 you will be provided the option to install older\nversions as well.\n35\n36\n814\n36 Eclipse Help\nIf you choose to install older versions of Eclipse a legacy folder location will be\ncreated in the documents folder to store User and Job called EclipseLegacy.\nEclipse 11 will continue to use the traditional storage location of\nDocuments/Eclipse.\nWindows File Explorer showing the Eclipse and EclipseLegacy folders.\nBecause of this new Legacy document location, users and jobs made in old\nversion are kept separate. All of your existing work will be found in Documents/Eclipse\nautomatically, but any new files created in old versions will be saved in\nDocuments/EclipseLegacy.\nThis system has been put in place to prevent the use of the same user.ini file in\nEclipse 11 and older versions.\n5.3 Keyless License or Hardware Key\nKeyless License or Hardware Key\nIf you purchased Eclipse with a Keyless License:\nÂ· When you install Eclipse, call in to account services, and they will\nemail you a keyless license file called Eclipse.lic.\no Save the license file to your desktop or downloads folder\no Connect your computer to the internet\no Run Eclipse and click Yes to install the license when prompted\nGetting Started 37\nÂ· After you enter it into your system, it is stored permanently.\nÂ· You can install on as many different computers as you like.\nÂ· Once this keyless license is activated, you can always use Eclipse\nwithout a key.\no You must connect to the internet and open Eclipse to keep your\nkeyless license active at least once every 30 days.\nÂ· For details on how your keyless license works, see the Keyless\nLicense help page.\nIf you are using a Hardware Key:\no The first time you run Eclipse, you may be prompted to update your\nhardware key. Contact Account Services to activate or upgrade your\nhardware key.\n5.3.1 Keyless License\nKeyless License\nWhen you install Eclipse, call in to support, and they will email you a\nlicense number. After you enter it into your system, it is stored permanently.\nYou can install on as many different computers as you like. Once this keyless\nlicense is activated, you can always use Eclipse without a key as long as you\nhave an Internet connection available.\nMultiple computers - If you run Eclipse on one system with the same\nlicense that is currently in use on another system, the other system will be\nsuspended. For example, if you are working in your office and you leave\nEclipse running and go into the courtroom, as soon as you run Eclipse in the\ncourtroom, the copy of Eclipse in your office will be suspended.\nNo Internet access - If you do not have an Internet connection\navailable, you can still use Eclipse off-line for up to 30 days. You will be given\ncountdown warnings within three days of the expiration of the off-line access.\nAs soon as you run Eclipse at all, even for a few seconds, with an Internet\nconnection available, it will reset the off-line access for another two weeks.\n37\n38 Eclipse Help\nIf the system discovers that the same license has been getting\nsignificant use on multiple computers simultaneously while off-line (avoiding\nthe automatic suspension) the off-line capability will automatically be\ndisabled, and you will then have to have Internet available to run Eclipse.\nNote that it does not disable the license entirely, just the offline capability.\nYou will have to contact the Advantage Software staff to restore off-line\ncapability.\nIMPORTANT: If you are using a keyless license on a computer that is\nshared among multiple users, EACH user MUST use a different Windows user\naccount. If several reporters in a courthouse share a single computer in a\ncourtroom, for example, even though they have separate computers in their\noffices, that is currently possible by allowing each individual user to bring\ntheir hardware key with them to plug into the courtroom computer. The\nkeyless license is associated with the current Windows user, so each user of a\nshared computer MUST have a separate Windows user account, and must log\nin when using Eclipse on that computer. This is the only way to prevent\naccidental license violations or disruptions if a user attempts to use the\nshared computer while it's associated with another user's keyless license.\nThe Support menu/About Eclipse... dialog will give you information\nabout the status of your license: If you see a capital \"O\" that indicates that\nthe license is only usable on-line. That is, you cannot use the license unless\nyou have an Internet connection available. This should only happen if the\nsystem detects some sort of license violation. If you are working offline,\nwhich is normally permitted, you will see a capital \"F\" indicating that the\nsystem is running offline and was not able to contact the license\nmanagement server. In this case, the dialog will include an indication such\nas (48 hours) telling you how much longer you can use the key while offline\nbefore you have to run Eclipse while you have access to the Internet in order\nto re-validate the license.\nQ&A about Keyless Licenses\nQ: What if I don't ever have Internet access available on a particular\ncomputer, even if it's only for five seconds once every two weeks?\nA: Then keep using the hardware key.\nQ: Can I mix and match the hardware key and keyless versions?\nA: Not with the same license. A single copy of Eclipse can either be\nkeyed or keyless, but not both. For the testing period, testers will be\npermitted to keep both, but that will only be for a short time.\nQ: What if a computer is authorized but I haven't used it for several\nmonths?\nA: There will be a grace period for a few days before you need an\ninternet connection.\nQ: What if I am running offline, but need to go work on another\ncomputer? Will I be in violation of the license?\nGetting Started 39\nA: Not if you suspend the license temporarily, which you can do one\nof two ways:\n1. Go to Tools/Edit toggles and check the Suspend key option. As\nsoon as you click OK or uncheck that box, it will resume running.\n2. Go to Support/About Eclipse. When the About... dialog is open,\nthe license is suspended.\n5.3.2 Convenience Key\nConvenience Key\nIf you plan to use one computer for realtime or editing, and another\ncomputer at home or at the office, you can purchase a Eclipse convenience\nkey.\nThe convenience key is not designed to be your primary key, and should not\nbe used at the same time as your primary key, which would be a violation of\nyour license agreement.\nEclipse keeps track of when the 2 keys are being used, and about once every\n90 days Eclipse will prompt you to insert an Authorization Disk. With your\nconvenience key attached, you can go to Support/About Eclipse and find\nout how long it will be before you have to insert your Authorization (Key)\nDisk. In the illustration below, you can see there are 91 days until Eclipse will\nask for an Authorization Disk.\nIf the main key were attached, it would say Authorization level: T.\n40 Eclipse Help\nÂ· To create the authorization disk, on your main computer, go to User\nsettings/Input/Read from and click Setup to choose your flash drive or\nwhatever drive you want to use.\nÂ· Then go to the Tools menu/Convenience key media.. to open the dialog.\nÂ· Insert your media, and press OK and the dialog will close when the\nprocedure is finished.\nÂ· Take the drive or disk to the computer where the convenience key is\nattached and when it prompts you for the Authorization disk, press OK to\nbe reauthorized for another 90 days.\nÂ· Your main key is permanently authorized, so you only need to make an\nAuthorization disk for your convenience key.\nÂ· Note: always keep the date and time correct on both computers.\n5.3.3 Convenience Key Disk\nConvenience Key Disk\nIf you own a convenience key, you will occasionally need to make a\nConvenience Key Disk.\nGetting Started 41\nWhen you run Eclipse using the convenience key, you may be warned\nthat you have a certain number of days remaining to create a convenience\nkey disk. When that number of days passes, you must insert a convenience\nkey disk, or you will not be able to use the convenience key. To see how\nmany days remain before you need to make the disk, go to Support/About\nEclipse. The Authorization level will be something like TK(91), in which\ncase you have 91 days left. If you are not using a convenience key, it will\njust say T.\nYou must make the convenience key disk on the computer where the\nmain key is used. To do this, put a blank, formatted floppy disk in the drive,\nand select Convenience Key Disk from the Tools menu. Follow the prompts\nto create the disk.\nAny drive can be used to make the Convenience Key Disk. To designate\na drive, go to the Input tab of User Settings, and set your Read Notes\nFrom location to the drive you want to use. Any folder or storage\nmedia can be used as a \"disk\" for purposes of making the Convenience Key\nDisk.\nThe next time you use your convenience key, Eclipse will ask for a key\ndisk. Insert the disk in the drive, or make sure the drive you chose is\navailable, and then press Enter.\n227\n42 Eclipse Help\n6 Quick Start Guide\nQuick Start Guide\nThis section covers the basics of running Eclipse.\nEach task has links to more detailed help pages, and many will also\nhave links to visualizer movies.\nFor most tasks in Eclipse, you will have a number of ways to issue a\ncommand or open a dialog. If a help file describes only one way to do a task,\nit is probably the most frequently used, or the most convenient, but you can\nexperiment with others to see what works best for you.\nFor example, to open a Help page, you can do the following:\nHit the Speed Key F1 or\nClick on the Support drop-down menu, and click on Help topics or\nHit Alt (or F10) then H, then H again or\nClick the Toolbar icon.\nSome help files will include a chart of some of the ways to issue a\ncommand. The chart below shows some of the ways to open the Help system.\nIf you are in a dialog, or have highlighted a menu item, the related help page\nwill open when you press F1.\nCommand Help\nSpeed Key F1\nMenu F10/Support\nToolbar Icon\nQuick Start Guide 43\n6.1 Running Eclipse\nRunning Eclipse\nTo run Eclipse for the first time:\n1. You can open Eclipse by double clicking the Eclipse icon on your desktop. Or\nyou can open the Start menu and select Eclipse from the list of programs. In\nolder versions of Windows, on your Windows taskbar (which usually extends\nacross the bottom of your screen), select Start, point to Programs (or All\nPrograms), and select Eclipse Application. In Windows 8 or 10, you would\nclick the drop-down list under Advantage Software, and select Eclipse. You can\nalso open the Start menu by pressing the Windows key (the one with the\nWindows logo) if you have one on your keyboard, or press Ctrl+Esc.\n2. Eclipseâs main program window opens. The first time you run the program, the\nNew user setup wizard appears and guides you through the process of\nsetting up a user. \"Users\" are introduced in the help topic \"Users and User\nSettings \", with more detailed descriptions in the \"Working with... Users \"\nhelp page, and the User Settings section of Help.\nThe New user setup wizard creates a new user file, a new (empty) main\ndictionary, and a folder for storing job-related files. The default directories for your\nuser settings, jobs, and blocks are in your Documents folder. (The Jobs folder is where\nyour notes (*.not), transcripts (*.ecl) and dictionaries (*.dix) will be stored.\nYou will be prompted to enter your name, and a short form of your name, which\nwill be used as the name of your Jobs folder, settings file, and main dictionary.\nUpdates and fixes\nWhen you run Eclipse, it asks the Connection Magic server if there is any critical\ninformation. If necessary, you will be notified directly if there are things like planned\nserver outages for upgrades, etc. It will also notify you if there is a more recent\nupdate available and will open a web browser to the appropriate download page if\nrequested.\nThe Main Program Window\nWhen you start Eclipse, the main program window appears with a selection\nwindow (Users) that lists the users on the system. The program will default to the\nlast user working on the software. Select the user desired and click OK or press\nEnter.\n99 108\n99\n44 Eclipse Help\nNote: Eclipse dialog boxes,\nincluding this selection window, have\nseveral unique controls which are\ndescribed below.\nYou can re-size the main\nprogram window just as you would\nany other window. Move your cursor\nto any of the windows borders, and\nwhen the mouse pointer becomes a\ntwo-pointed arrow you can click and\ndrag the border to where you want\nit.\nTo expand the main program\nwindow to the full size of your\nscreen, click the maximize button\n(upper right corner of your window).\nWhen the window is âmaximized,â it\nwill fill the screen and cannot be\nrepositioned or manually re-sized. To\nmake a maximized window movable\nand re-sizable, click the restore\nbutton.\nThe major parts of the main\nprogram window are the Title bar,\nthe Main menus, the Toolbars, the\ndocument display area, the Info bar,\nand the Status bar. The Toolbars,\nInfo bar and Status bar can all be\nturned off or on, and the Toolbars\nand Info bar are customizable. The\nmenu bar includes the Connection\nStatus indicators, at the right-hand corner.\nThe Title Bar displays the version of Eclipse you are running, your user name,\nand the name of the current document (if any is open).\nNote that one of the toolbars pictured above is docked at the bottom of the\npage. This is an option; the default positions are all at the top. You can re-position the\ntoolbars by un-docking them and placing them anywhere on the page, the same way\nyou would in other Windows programs.\nAt the top-right of the screen, on the menu bar, a series of lights appears with\nthree-letter codes. A green light indicates that the connection is working. A red light\nindicates that the connection is not working. Some lights will turn red simply because\nyou're not using them. Details on the codes are on the Connection Status\nIndicators 115 help page.\nQuick Start Guide 45\nYou will find several useful commands for adjusting the appearance of the main\ndocument window on the Window menu.\nMain View Toolbar\nThe first time you run Eclipse, a toolbar appears offering easy access to nine basic\nfunctions of your work:\n1. Help opens Eclipseâs online help system.\n2. Settings takes you to User Settings where you can enter the basic\ninformation Eclipse needs before you start working.\n3. Read notes from your steno machine.\n1084\n99\n46 Eclipse Help\n4. Translate the notes into English.\n5. Realtime â begin writing and translating in Realtime.\n6. Notes â open a note file.\n7. Transcript â open an Eclipse text file.\n8. Dictionary â open a dictionary file.\n9. Hyperkeys â toggle hyperkeys on or off.\nOther functions on the icon bar are grayed out because they are not currently\navailable. For example, the Spellcheck, Print and Ascii functions are only available\nwhen you have a document (transcript or dictionary) open.\nInfo bar\nWhen you open Eclipse for the first time, you will see a window along the left\nside of the screen. This Info bar can be turned on and off using the Window\nmenu/View/view Info bar checkbox. You can right-click anywhere inside the Info\nbar to adjust the settings.\nThe Info bar displays AutoMagic , which offers up to 10 suggestions, with their\nhotkeys, for the actions you are most likely to want to perform at any given time. For\ndetails on using and customizing your Info bar, see the Info bar help page .\nStatus bar\nThe status bar is the horizontal bar at the very bottom of your main program\nwindow (do not confuse this with the Windows Task bar, which is usually at the very\nbottom of the screen). For details on the Status bar, see the Status Bar help page .\nSome document windows, such as note files, also have status bars. The status\nbar is a valuable (but often overlooked) aid that can help you avoid apparently\nstrange problems that have simple solutions (like accidentally turning Eclipse\nHyperkeys on or off).\nThe main program status bar indicates the volume, page, line, column, and\ntimecodes (which appear in the same format as in the text - as set in the User\nsettings/Document/Timecodes/Time printing settings) of the current document\n(based on the position of the cursor in the document). The total page count / last\npage number that appears on the status bar will be updated after a few seconds every\ntime you make a change in the program.\nThe outlined rectangles on the right side of the status bar work like indicator\nlights. One- to four-letter abbreviations appear in the rectangle and show which\nmodes are active:\nMLT - Multi-scan is turned on\nHYP - Hyperkeys is turned on\nSRV - Connection to a Connection Magic server is active\nCurrent realtime mode:\nKEY â key mode\nCOR - correction mode\nSPL â spelling mode\n998\n52\n998\n1058\n1058\nQuick Start Guide 47\nSTC â stitch mode\nEDT - edit mode\nTask currently being performed:\nX â TCP-IP disconnected\nM â modem on-line\nE â serial port error\nT â translating\nO â outputting to external programs (LawBridge, etc.)\nE â editing\nI â realtime input from the writer\nV â voice input from a speech engine\nThese indicators may appear in groups, such as TE for translating and editing.\nMoving toolbars\nEclipse toolbars can be repositioned anywhere on your screen, even outside of\nthe main program window. Use this feature to put toolbars where they are most\nconvenient for your needs. When a toolbar is locked to a window border, it appears as\na single row or column of buttons. You can click-and-drag to reposition the toolbar\nalong a border. When a toolbar is not locked to a border, it has its own title-bar and\ncan be reshaped into a grid of buttons with more than one row or column. These\ntoolbars are called âfloatingâ because you cannot hide them under other windowsâ\nthey always float on top.\nIf you want to reposition a toolbar, position your mouse pointer within this\nborder, but not over a button, and then click-and-drag the toolbar.\nTo reshape a floating toolbar, click-and-drag the borders.\nEclipse remembers your toolbarsâ positions and docking state, and re-loads the\nlast used positions when you open the program or load your user settings. Your\ncustomized toolbars are saved in your current .ini file, so you can have different\narrangements of toolbars for all of the different ways you work, for example, one\narrangement for realtime and one for editing.\nTip: If you want to position a floating toolbar near the sides of a window, hold\nthe Ctrl key down while moving the toolbar. This prevents the toolbar from locking to\nthe border.\nFor instructions on Customizing your toolbars, go to the help page, Customize\nToolbars .\nVISUALIZE\nRS:\n951\n48 Eclipse Help\nM1 - Info-bar\nA2 - Toolbars\nA2b1 - Docking and undocking toolbars\n6.2 Keyboard Shortcuts\nKeyboard Shortcuts\nRELATES TO: Keyboard\nDefinitions , Hyperkeys ,\nDefault Shortcuts and\nHyperkeys\nYou can issue most commands either by using the mouse to pull down\nthe menu and select the command, or by using a keyboard shortcut, or by\nclicking the toolbar icon.\nEclipse commands' keyboard shortcuts appear next to the command on\npull-down menus. In the Production menu, pictured below, you can see the\nshortcuts for Open Notes (Shift+F7), Open Text (Alt+E), etc.\nNote that although the keys appear as upper case letters (eg. Alt+E),\nyou do not use the shift key when typing the shortcut unless it is specified.\nTo do so would trigger a different command. For example, Alt+E is Open\ntext, while Shift+Alt+E is Edit Toggles.\nFor key combinations such\nas Shift+F7, press and hold\ndown the Shift key and press\nthe F7 key, and then release\nboth keys.\nThe function keys\n(designated as (F1, F2, F3, etc.)\nare usually located across the top\nof the keyboard, and can be used\nalone or in conjunction with the\nShift, Alt, or Ctrl keys. Do not\nconfuse them with the letter F\nkey.\nMany reporters like to\nfurther streamline the giving of\ncommands by using single-key editing, called Hyperkeys in Eclipse.\nWhen you turn on Hyperkeys, the character keys on the keyboard no longer\nrepresent letters but trigger Eclipse commands and macros. For example, G\nis the Hyperkey for a one-stroke global. A chart of Hyperkeys is in your\ndocumentation folder (Support/Documentation).\n1008 315\n770\n315\nQuick Start Guide 49\nYou can also access menu items by pressing the key for the underlined\nletter. For main menu items, for example, to pull down the File menu, press\nand release Alt, then press f. To pull down the Production menu, press Alt\nthen press p. You can continue to use the underlined letters to move into\nmenu items. For example, To open the Production menu and then the \"Open\nNotes\" dialog, press Alt, then p, then n.\nYou can find a list of the Keyboard shortcuts by going to the User\nsettings/Edit tab and clicking the Keyboard... button. They can be\ncustomized, but we recommend using the defaults until you are thoroughly\nfamiliar with them. Details on customization are in the Keyboard\nDefinitions help page, and in the Visualizer, Keyboard Changes.\nThe Reference Guide lists the default keyboard shortcuts for both the\nstandard keyboard and Hyperkeys. Printable keyboard templates are also\navailable on the Eclipse disk and are installed along with the Eclipse manuals\nin the Documentation folder. These templates show the shortcuts on a\nkeyboard layout. The files are in PDF format and require Adobeâs Acrobat\nReader to view and print. Note that these documents are for viewing only and\ncannot be edited.\n6.3 Info Bar and AutoMagic\nInfo Bar and AutoMagic\nWhen you open Eclipse for the first time, you will see a window along the left side of\nthe screen. This is the Info bar, which can be turned on and off using the Window\nmenu/View/view Info bar checkbox.

For\nexample, when you open Eclipse, you can press 1 to Reopen the job you were\nworking on when you last were in Eclipse. Or you can press 2 for User settings, 3 to\nRead notes, etc.\nQuick Start Guide 51\nYou will be able to select one of the options or execute one of the commands by\npressing the number key on your keyboard, or using the Speed key (or Hyperkey)\nshown on the right, or by clicking on the selection.\nYou will notice that different options are offered when you are:\nâ¢ At the opening screen (no document open)\nâ¢ In a note file\nâ¢ In a note file with strokes marked\nâ¢ In a dictionary\nâ¢ In an empty dictionary\nâ¢ In a text file\nâ¢ In a marked block of text\nâ¢ At the end of a paragraph\nâ¢ At the beginning of a paragraph\nâ¢ On a conflict\nâ¢ On an untranslate\nâ¢ On a misspelled word\nâ¢ On a form field\nâ¢ etc.\nThe suggested operation may be an actual command that also appears on the\nmenus.

(Note that you can re-do the jump to Last edit point up to five times to\ncontinue jumping back through your edits. After 5 jumps, it will cycle back through\nthe last 5 edit points again, in case you missed the one you were looking for.)\n52 Eclipse Help\nIn some cases, the AutoMagic display\nwill show the results instead of the\ncommand. For example, when putting the\ncursor on âdo youâ instead of saying âWord\nflipâ it will show the icon, the keystroke,\nand âyou doâ instead.\nSome examples of suggestions that AutoMagic might make:\ntheretical --> theoretical or heretical\nis she --> she is\nthey're --> they are\nhe is --> he's\nforming --> form\nare throw SKOPic --> arthroscopic (4)\nthey they --> they or they -- they\nto --> do\nthree car --> three-car\nlook over --> look-over\ndid yes --> did, yes\nIf the suggestion has a number in parentheses after it, it is a global, and the\nnumber indicates how many strokes are suggested for the global. For example, if it\nshows \"define (2)\" it means that two strokes, starting with the stroke the cursor is on,\nshould be globalled together to make the word \"define.\"\nFurther details about using AutoMagic, along with links to a number of\nvisualizers, are on the following help page , and here .\n6.4 AutoMagic\nAutoMagic\nRELATES TO: Info bar, AutoMagic Display\noptions,\nAutoMagic Numbered Choices,\nAutoMagic in a Dictionary,\nAutoMagic in a Notes file,\nAutoMagic - Untranslates and Globaling,\nAutoMagic with Conflicts,\nAutoMagic - Marked Blocks of Text,\nAutoMagic - Numbers,\nAutoMagic - Paragraphs,\nAutoMagic - Punctuation,\n52 399\n998\n404\n409\n214\n242\n405\n403\n396\n408\n407\n412\nQuick Start Guide 53\nAutoMagic Spelling help,\nAutoMagic basic features\nIn the Info bar , listed from 1 to 0 (10), you will find the most likely\ncommands or options that you might want to use, depending on where you are\nlocated.

The menus\nare File, Recent, Production, Move, Edit, Block, Format, Tools, Window and\nSupport.\nTo view a menu, press and release the Alt key, then press the letter that is\nunderlined in the menu title. For example, to open the File menu you would press Alt\nthen F. When the items on a menu are displayed, you can select an item by pressing\nthe letter that is underlined on its label. So, to run the conversion wizard, press Alt\nthen T to open the Tools menu, and then press C to select Convert, which opens the\nwizard. You can also use the F10 key in place of the Alt key to access the menus, but\nnot both at the same time.\nTo learn about a specific menu item, highlight the item and press F1. (To\nhighlight a menu item using the keyboard, open the menu, and then use the down\narrow key to move to the desired item. If the item indicates a submenu, press the\nright arrow key to move to the items on the submenu.)\nToolbar icons appear to the left of each menu\nitem that matches a toolbar function. If a menu\nitem has no icon, there is no toolbar button to\nexecute that function. A menu item that is disabled\nwill show the icon using dimmed colors.\nToolbar icons and graphics auto-scale to the\nsize indicated by your windows scaling, including\nthe graphics shown on dialogs. This makes dialogs\neasier to operate at large scales on high-resolution\nmonitors.\nIf you execute a function that has a corresponding toolbar button, the dialog will\nhave that icon graphic placed in the upper left corner to help you intuitively identify\ncommands with toolbar buttons, just as the icons on the menus do.\nQuick Start Guide 57\nIcons on the Recent menu items help you tell at a glance between recently used\ntext files, dictionaries, and notes, making it easier to find the job you were working on\npreviously.\nMenu\nname\nDescription\nFile Functions that affect an entire document file. Use the File menu to open,\nprint, import, export, and perform similar document operations.\nRecent Lists recently opened text files, up to the last 18 files openedâa handy\nshortcut for getting to frequently used files. To open a recently opened\nfile, simply click on the filename appearing on the recent-documents list.\nIf a file has been deleted it may still be listed under the Recent menu, but\nif you try to open the file under the Recent menu and it no longer exists,\nEclipse will create it on the fly but it will be a blank file. (Note: the recently\nused documents on the Start button/My Recent Documents submenu in\nWindows also works with Eclipse documents and will automatically open\nthe Eclipse program if necessary.)\nProductio\nn\nTranscript creation functions. In addition to commands for opening\nspecific types of documents (dictionary, text, or note files), this menu\nallows you to read notes, start and stop translation of notes, and perform\nseveral production-related tasks, such as spell checking. User settings\nare also accessed from this menu.\nMove Provides commands for navigating the active document and positioning\nthe cursor, scanning functions (which automatically move the cursor to\nproblem areas in a transcript), and Find command.\nEdit Editing related commands specific to the type of file currently open (text,\ndictionary, or notes).\nBlock Mark sections of a document and then perform operations on that section.\nBlocking is an efficient method of joining or separating documents. You\ncan, for example, block a section of transcript and create a new file\ncontaining only that section.\nFormat This menu provides commands for altering the appearance of the\ntranscript, such as fonts, line spacing, and paragraph formats.\nTools File management utilities, including wizards that simplify file backups,\nrestorations, and conversions from other formats.

You can also display or hide the status bar and\ntoolbars. When a transcript window is active, choose whether to display\n58 Eclipse Help\nsteno notes, paragraph bar, ruler, and realtime status. You can also turn\non the Script list window, and toggle on or off the Closed Captioning\nPreview screen.\nSupport Eclipseâs online help system. When Eclipse is running, the online help is\nthe fastest way to find information to help you use the program. You can\nreview entire topics (e.g. creating a dictionary), connect to Advantage\nSoftwareâs website, use Visualizer files, or read the manual.\n6.5.1 Toolbars\nToolbars\nEclipse has six toolbars, each of which is completely customizable. The\nfirst toolbar initially contains buttons for common commands found\nthroughout the menus. The toolbars are accessed through the Window\nmenu/Customize toolbars command.\nThe Window/View toggles command includes checkboxes to turn\non or off each of the toolbar views.\nLike menu items, the availability of toolbar buttons depends on the\ncontext within which you are working. For example, when you are working in\na note file, the toolbar button for Multi-scan is inactive (the Multi-scan\nfeature is not applicable in a note file). In the example below, which shows a\nportion of a toolbar without a document open, the Print and Spellcheck\nbuttons are not available. Inactive toolbar buttons are gray.\nTo use an active toolbar button, position the mouse pointer over the\nbutton and click.\n6.5.1.1 Moving toolbars\nMoving toolbars\n951\n116\nQuick Start Guide 59\nEclipse toolbars can be repositioned anywhere on your screen, even\noutside of the main program window. Use this feature to put toolbars where\nthey are most convenient for your needs. When a toolbar is locked to a\nwindow border, it appears as a single row or column of buttons. You can\nclick-and-drag to reposition the toolbar along a border. When a toolbar is not\nlocked to a border, it has its own title-bar and can be reshaped into a grid of\nbuttons with more than one row or column. These toolbars are called\nâfloatingâ because you cannot hide them under other windowsâthey always\nfloat on top.\nIf you want to reposition a toolbar, position your mouse pointer within\nthis border, but not over a button, and then click-and-drag the toolbar.\nTo reshape a floating toolbar, click-and-drag the borders.\nEclipse remembers your toolbarsâ positions and docking state, and reloads\nthe last used positions when you open the program or load your user\nsettings. Your customized toolbars are saved in your current .ini file, so you\ncan have different arrangements of toolbars for all of the different ways you\nwork, for example, one arrangement for realtime and one for editing.\n6.6 File Dialogs\nFile Dialogs\nEclipse has a customized file dialog, simplifying the process of opening and\nwriting files.\nWhen you select File/Open notes, for example, the Open File dialog opens,\nlisting just the Note files in your Job folder.\n60 Eclipse Help\nYou will see that the keyboard focus is in the Name box (which defaults to\nempty). You can immediately type letters to narrow the list to files beginning with the\nletters you type, arrow up or down (or click on the name) to select the file you want,\nthen hit Enter or OK to open the file. If you type a partial file name, it searches for all\nfiles starting with the text you type. If you continue typing until there are no initial\nmatches, the dialog will instead show all partial matches whether they are at the\nbeginning of the file name or not.\nTo get from the filename box to the list of files, it is necessary only to hit the up\nor down arrow keys. You do not need to hit an Alt+Letter key or Shift+Tab -- just the\nup arrow or down arrow.\nSelecting a file from the list will fill in the name box. Typing a name in the name\nbox will highlight the first file in the list that matches, or no file at all if no file\nmatches. This allows you to easily cross-check for accidentally typing a new name\nthat matches an existing file.\nYou can use the * wildcard to specify file that match a particular ending. So, just\nas typing \"smi\" will find all of the files that start with \"smi\", typing \"*2014\" will find\nall of the filenames that END with 2014.\nIf you need to open a file in a different location, you can click on another folder\nin the left-hand pane, and the display will list the note files in that location. Note that\nchanging location will clear any partial file names, or wildcards you have entered in\nthe Name box.\nSubfolders appear in the file list.\nQuick Start Guide 61\nThe subfolders get narrowed just as files do when you type letters into the\nfilename box, so just typing \"b\" would list your jobs starting with \"b\" and your folders\nstarting with \"b\" such as your \"blocks\" folder. This will will make it easier to find files\nor folders if you have a lot of subfolders taking up space on the list.\nWhen you double-click (or click to highlight and hit Enter or OK) on a subfolder\nfrom this list, it will navigate immediately into that folder, and will show further subsub-\nfolders. You can then select from nested folders without having to create special\nFile locations for them manually.\nIf you go to File/Open text, the Open File dialog will display the transcript\nfiles in your Job folder. Again, you can click on any folder in the left pane to find the\nfile you want to open.\nIf you have subfolders such as Realtime or Archive in your job folder, and you\nwant them to appear on your Name list, go User settings/Programming/File\nlocations and add REALTIME={JOB}Realtime and ARCHIVE={JOB}Archive and then\nthose would appear as separate items on the list, complete with their own subfolders,\nif applicable.\nIf you have many subfolders, they may fill up the display. The file list will scroll\ndown when it first displays so that you can always see at least the first file name.\n62 Eclipse Help\nThe Location List\nThe Location list on the left side of the dialog contains only those locations that\nthe Eclipse software cares about, such as JOB and BLOCK. Selecting one of these\nitems will immediately update the file list.\nIf you hit the gear icon above the locations, it will open the User\nsettings/Programming/File locations dialog. Adding or modifying the file\nlocations will immediately update the contents of the file dialog to reflect those\nchanges.\nThe size of the folder pane and file list can be modified by dragging the border\nbetween them.\nThere is a drop-list on the lower-right that can be used to select different file\ntypes. When opening a specific type, such as a transcript, there will be only one\noption. When doing functions such as an import, it may have several options.\nThe file list itself will show the file name and extension, the file size, and the\ncreation and modified dates. It will also show an icon for the file. This icon will usually\nmatch the icon that Windows explorer shows, but it will often show an Eclipse-specific\nicon that is more appropriate, such as the \"notes\" icon in the example below.\n839\nQuick Start Guide 63\nIn some cases, the icon not match the Windows icon. For example, Eclipse\ndoesn't register the .mac extension itself, but some systems see it as a \"MacPaint\nimage\" even though Eclipse is using it as a portable macro file. Eclipse will show a\nHyperkey icon for that file, rather than a photo or picture icon.\nCustomizing the display\nÂ· The Name, Size, Created, and Modified columns can be clicked to sort the\nfiles forward or backward by the information in that column.\nÂ· The columns auto-resize to fit the content.\nÂ· Each folder you visit will store the sort column and forward/reverse order\nseparately, so you can have your jobs sorted by creation date and your blocks\nsorted alphabetically, for example. Note that the folder headers will show \"<\"\nand \">\" symbols to indicate which column is being sorted, and in what\ndirection. In the example above, the files are sorted by date Created, most\nrecent first.\nÂ· This is an Eclipse dialog , so it can take advantage of the \"customize\"\nfunctionality for resizing, changing the zoom, anchoring the position, or adding\ntransparency.\nIf you need to access the Windows file dialog, click the Browse button.\n6.7 Dialog boxes, Windows, and Edit Boxes\nDialog boxes, Windows, and Edit Boxes\nNearly all the dialog boxes in Eclipse are adjustable. You can control the size,\nthe zoom level, transparency, change the fonts, and anchor them on the\nscreen. Some can be simplified, showing more or less of the dialog.\nNote: In versions of Windows from Vista forward, you must use the\nCustomize dialog function for all the above adjustments other than\nResizing.\n953\n66\n64 Eclipse Help\nEdit boxes\nSome dialogs, such as the globaling dialog, the Speaker boxes, the\nFind/replace dialog box, and dictionary entry editing, include edit boxes\nwhich have special characteristics.\nWhen your cursor is in the box, in addition to the Ctrl+ and Ctrlfunctions\nto zoom in and out, you can use Ctrl+K to cycle through three\nstates of capitalization (all caps, initial cap, and all lower case).\nYou can use Ctrl+W to open the Special Characters dialog.\nButton to access advanced editing functions\nAll extended edit boxes contain a \"<<\" button to the right of the edit\nbox. Press this button to see a context menu showing all of the possible\nenhanced editing functions. You can select items from this menu, but you\ncan also use it to look up the keystrokes and familiarize yourself with how to\nuse these functions without the menu.\nThere is a sub-menu with the Dialog\ndisplay adjustments...\n375\nQuick Start Guide 65\nand another that lets you insert special characters, the date, a prefix/suffix,\nor surround the text in the edit box in braces.\nThe Google it (F5) menu item will perform a Google search for the contents\nof the edit box, or the marked block inside it, if applicable.\n6.7.1 Resizing\nResizing\n66 Eclipse Help\nYou can resize many Eclipse dialogs by \"grabbing\" a side or corner with\nthe mouse, and moving it in or out.\nYou can resize a dialog to\nsee more information. For\nexample, if you resize the spell\ncheck dialog vertically, you can\nsee more words on the\nalternates list at once.\nYou can also resize\nhorizontally, for example, to be\nable to see longer words in text\nboxes that contain only one\nline. Some controls will stretch\nvertically, some horizontally,\nand some will simply move out\nof the way.\nFor dialogs that don't\nhave long lists or multi-line\nedit boxes, some single-line\nedit boxes (like the globaling\ndialog) will expand vertically\nand the font within that box\nwill grow larger.\n6.7.2 Customize dialog\nCustomize dialog\nAs an alternative to using the icons on the title bar, you can make the\nsame adjustments using the Customize Dialog. Open the dialog by clicking\non the icon in the upper\nleft corner of any dialog\nbox, or using Alt +\nSpacebar, and selecting\nCustomize...\nThe Customize dialog\ncontains controls to set\nthe Zoom and\nTransparency using\nsliders or spin controls.\nThere are check boxes to\nturn on or off the\nAnchor , and Show all to show more or fewer elements of the dialog.\nThe Reset button returns all controls to the default settings.\n67\n67\n69 68\nQuick Start Guide 67\n6.7.3 Zooming\nZooming\nZooming makes the dialog larger and easier to read. If you see a\nmagnifying glass on the title bar of any dialog, move the mouse over it. You\nwill note that the mouse turns into a left/right arrow, meaning that you can\nclick and drag it left or right.\nWhen you click and drag\nleft or right, the entire dialog\nchanges size and scales every\ncontrol in it, changing the\nfont size if applicable. Every\ndialog preserves its own\nunique scaling setting,\nbecause you might want to\nmake some dialogs small but\nstretched out with lots of\ninformation (such as the\nmacro editor) and other dialogs large with a small amount of easy-to-read\ninformation (such as the globaling dialog.)\nIf you are using the Customize menu, use the zoom percentage box,\nspin control, or the slider to zoom in and out.\nOn some dialogs, if the cursor is on an edit box (such as globaling and\nfind/replace) you can press Ctrl+plus and Ctrl+minus to zoom the text\nlarger or smaller.\n6.7.4 Transparency\nTransparency\nIf you see an eye icon on the title bar of a dialog, note that you can move the\nmouse over it and it will turn to a left/right arrow. You can click and drag left or right.\nIf you move to the left, the dialog will become more transparent. If you move to\nthe right, it will become more opaque. The dialog will preserve this setting\npermanently.\nOn some dialogs, if the cursor is on an edit box (such as globaling and\nfind/replace) you can press Ctrl+O to toggle the âfadingâ on and off. The\ntransparency level you have selected for that dialog will still be stored permanently.\nThis allows you to leave the dialog opaque most of the time but to easily âpeekâ under\nit if you need to without having to close the entire dialog and then re-select the\ncommand.\n68 Eclipse Help\n6.7.5 Font selection\nFont selection\nIn the User settings/Display tab there is a âUI fontâ button (short for\nâUser Interfaceâ.) If you change the font selection in this dialog, it will affect\nthe fonts on every control on the extended dialogs. This will change the font\non buttons, lists, edit boxes, etc. You can select bold fonts, italics, whatever\nyou like. The size, however, will ultimately be determined by the zoom level\nfor the dialog, so pay no attention to the size selector.\nImportant note: Some fonts are unusually wide for their height and\nmay be too wide. If you pick a font that's too wide, you may see words on\nthe right side of some controls get cut off, such as a checkbox being labeled\nâPrint commanâ instead of âPrint commands.â If you select an incorrect ui\nfont (or editing font too), you can get the default back by selecting the Font\nbutton then Cancel out.\n6.7.6 Simplification\nSimplification\nSome dialogs are fairly frequently used but contain a lot of controls that\nare rarely used, or controls that many users have already memorized.\nQuick Start Guide 69\nFor example, on the globaling dialog, most users remember Alt+C to\ncapitalize, or Ctrl+J for the job dictionary; or that you can hit [enter] for OK\nor [esc] for Cancel and really doesn't need the OK and Cancel buttons\ntaking up space. You can hide the seldom-used buttons on a dialog box to\ngain more uncovered screen space.\nFor the globaling dialog, for example, this hides all the controls but the\ntext box where you type in the entry.\nYou can use Ctrl+[ to show less and Ctrl+] to show more. You can also\nchoose Show more or Show less from the Dialog display submenu of the\n<< feature.\nThe dialogs that can show less or more are:\nÂ· Any generic \"enter some text here\" dialog, such as the one the User\nsettings/User/Save settings button shows. The OK and Cancel\nbuttons are hidden, and you can use [enter] or [escape].\nÂ· The Find dialog, which collapses to just the find string.\nÂ· The Globaling dialog, which collapses to just the text.\nÂ· The \"go to\" dialog, which collapses to just page/line.\nÂ· The \"Insert index item\" dialog, which collapses to just\nindex/item/description.\nÂ· The realtime output dialog, which collapses to just the output and\ndevice information.\nÂ· The steno emulator dialog, which collapses to just the steno and the\nbuttons on the right.\nÂ· The Translation dialog, which collapses to just the filename,\ntranslation type and dictionaries.\n6.7.7 Anchoring\nAnchoring\nMany dialogs are pre-programmed to appear in certain locations. Others\nsimply default to the middle of the screen. Others will automatically move\nout of the way of the cursor if they're frequent editing commands such as\nglobaling or filling in blanks. However, if you have a particular spot you wish\nfor a dialog to appear every time it appears, you can move the dialog to that\nlocation and anchor it.\nThe Anchor button is on the Customize dialog 66 .\n70 Eclipse Help\nMove a window the desired location and check anchor to ensure that\ndialog always displays in that location.\n6.8 File types\nFile types\nEclipse uses three main types of files: notes, text, and dictionary files.\nEach of these types has its own three-letter file extension (three letters that\nappear after a period at the end of a file name):\n.not notes (steno)\n.ecl text files (such as transcript or other documents)\n.dix dictionaries\nYou will probably encounter other file types when converting, importing,\nor exporting documents, such as text or ASCII (.txt), Rich-Text Format (.rtf),\nor Bridge (.brg) files. When working with multimedia files, Eclipse can use\nsound files (.wav), and video plus sound (Audio-Video Integrated) files,\n(.avi).\nQuick Start Guide 71\nNote files\nNote files use the â.notâ file extension. They are the\nraw files from which Eclipse creates a text translation.\nNote files contain steno notes and timecodes (if your\nsteno machine has timecode capability, and it is enabled). If\nthere are no time codes provided by the writer, there will be\nno valid time codes within the note file although there will be numbers where\nthe timecodes would be. They reflect the time the job was read in rather than\nthe time the job was taken. You create note files when you âread inâ steno to\nEclipse from a writer using the cable, a diskette, or a RAM card. A note file is\nalso created when you translate in realtime.\nTo open a note file, press Shift+F7, or the File menu/Open notes\ncommand, or the toolbar button.\naib.not files are files that are created with the use of the Boost or Boost\nFlow features.\nEclipse text files\nEclipse text files use the â.eclâ file extension. In\naddition to storing text, Eclipse text files store steno notes,\nsteno writer time codes, and text and document formatting\ninformation. This enables you to transport text files from one\nEclipse user to another without the loss of this information.\nTo open a text file in Eclipse, press Alt+E, or the File menu/Open text\ncommand, or the toolbar button.\nDictionary files\nDictionary files have â.dixâ file extensions. Dictionary\nfiles contain steno outlines and their definitions, which Eclipse\nuses when translating a job. You automatically have a main\ndictionary, and each job has its own dictionary (for job-specific\nentries). You can also have other specialized dictionaries, such\nas one for medical or engineering related work.\nTo open a dictionary in Eclipse, press F9, or the File menu/Open\ndictionary command, or the toolbar button .\n224\n694\n672\n72 Eclipse Help\nPython Plugin files\nPython plugins are represented as \".py\" files in C:\n\\Users\\YourName\\Documents\\Eclipse\\Python-plugins\nClosing and Saving files\nAs you work, Eclipse automatically saves your files, so\nwhen you close a note file, text file, or dictionary file there is\nno need to save it.\nYou can close any file using File menu/Close, or\nCtrl+Q, or the toolbar button.\nFile Manager\nEclipse utilizes a custom File Manager that enables you to perform\nmany functions including Copy/move, rename, delete, zip/unzip,\nbackup/restore, translate, open, print, ascii, and revert.\nIt includes an Info box that lists statistics and other\ninformation (such as speaker names, and the name of the last\nperson who edited it) about each file. For a detailed\ndescription of the File manager, see Working with File\nManager , and the File Manager help page in the Reference\nGuide.\nTo open File Manager in Eclipse, press Ctrl+F or the Tools menu/File\nmanager, or the toolbar button.\n6.9 Where Do I Start?\nWhere Do I Start?\nThis section gives a brief overview of the steps involved in creating a\ntranscript with Eclipse and is not intended to provide a thorough description\nof all the functions. See the individual sections of the Help files for more\nthorough discussion of these topics.\n641\n677\n744\nQuick Start Guide 73\nSetting up a user\nFirst-time User\nWhen you start Eclipse for the first time, the New user setup wizard\nappears and guides you through the process of setting up a Eclipse user. The\nuser file that is created contains default settings that control the behavior of\nthe program. You can use the default user settings, and make changes while\nyou work.\nTransferring from another CAT System?\nIf you are transferring from another CAT system, you can start off using the\ndefault user settings, and make changes as you become familiar with the\nprogram.\nUser Settings\nThe User Settings dialog window provides access to all of your user settings.\nTo access the User settings dialog window, press Alt+U. The online help\nsystem contains extensive information on working with these user settings.\nTo access the online help for user settings, after opening User settings\npress F1 or click the Help button. You can also access User settings via\nbuttons in dialogs including the Translate, Print, Create ASCII, Insert\nindex item, and the Number conversion dialogs.\nPress the button or hit Alt+U to go directly to the appropriate tab in the user\nsettings without having to first exit the function.\nWhen you change any of the User settings values or options, the new\nsetting is automatically saved, although there is also a Save settings button\nthat may be used to save the settings as well. Most user settings are stored\nin a file with the extension â.iniâ (often referred to as an âinnyâ or âdot IâNâ\nI.â file). If you create more than one user, you will have an â.iniâ file for each\nuser. You can then âloadâ a different user by selecting the appropriate â.iniâ\nfile.\nYour current .ini file will be automatically backed up whenever you save the\nsettings or exit the program. These backups will go in the Backup folder as\nfilename.ub0, .ub1, .ub2, etc. up to ub9. You can access them using File\nmanager .\nConverting dictionaries\nWhen you create a new user, a main dictionary file is automatically created.\nThis dictionary is named username.dix and contains no entries. To get the\nentries from your old dictionaries into your main Eclipse dictionary, you can\nrun the conversion wizard.\nIf the conversion wizard does not support your CAT system, you must\nconvert the dictionary to an intermediate, universal format (e.g. RTF-CRE),\nconvert that to a new Eclipse dictionary, and import the converted entries.\nIn some cases, you may need the assistance of Advantage Software technical\nsupport to successfully convert a dictionary.\n75\n744\n74 Eclipse Help\nTo convert a dictionary with the conversion wizard\n1. Select\nConvert from\nthe Tools\nmenu.\n2. In the\nâConversion\nwizardâ\nwindow,\nselect From\nanother\nsystem\n3. Select the\nNext button.\n4. Follow the\ndirections in\nsubsequent\nwizard\nwindows to\ncomplete the\nprocess.\n5. The\nconverted\ndictionary\nentries are\nplaced in your\nmain Eclipse\ndictionary. If you want to view this dictionary, press F9 and then\nEnter.\nTo import a dictionary directly\n1. Convert the dictionary to a universal format, such as RTF-CRE (use the\ndictionaryâs native program, or a conversion utility, to convert the\ndictionary).\n2. Create a new dictionary in Eclipse. (Press F9, type a filename for the\ndictionary, press Enter, then press Enter again.)\n3. Select Import from the File menu. Use the file dialog window to select\nthe dictionary you want to import.\n4. The dialog in which you select you file(s) has a button to Select/deselect\nall the files listed.\nNote that you can also use the Conversion Wizard to import text files\n(including RTF and ASCII files) and note files from another CAT system. The\nwizard allows you to browse for a folder, and you can select and convert\nmultiple files at one time.\nNote also that AI data will import, but this is only compatible with\ndictionaries created with EclipseNT or Eclipse.\nQuick Start Guide 75\nYou can also use the Conversion Wizard to convert one or more of your\ndictionaries (or text or note files) to a different version, such as a Passport\nfile, or an rtf.\n6.9.1 Overview of User settings\nOverview of User settings\nWhenever you start Eclipse youâll be prompted to indicate which user\nsettings you want to use. The Users dialog box will show the available user\nsettings formats (with .ini extensions). Select the file name of the settings\nfile you want to use, then click OK to load the settings.\nThere is also a option to [Create new user] which sometimes makes more\nsense than selecting an existing user first then going to User\nsettings/User/Create new user.\n76 Eclipse Help\nYou need to pick a user settings file to use\nwhenever you start Eclipse, but you can\nchange to different settings after youâve\nstarted the program.\nTo use a settings file other than the one\nthat is currently in use, go to the User\nsettings/User tab.\nClick the Load settings button; you will get the same dialog box as when\nyou first start Eclipse. Select a user settings file and click OK, or double click\nthe file name. The user settings file will then be active for your session.\nNote: if you want Eclipse always to open the same user, you can do that by\nselecting âAutomatically load last settings usedâ in the Advanced User\nSettings .\nTo view the User Settings use the shortcut Alt+U and the User tab\nis displayed.\nThe User name field displays the name given when the user was\ncreated.\nThe User file field shows the name of the user-settings file that is\ncurrently loaded for the job. The default user file has the nickname you\nselected in the New User Wizard, and has the extension â.iniâ (e.g.,\nJSmith.ini ).\n905\n99\nQuick Start Guide 77\n6.9.1.1 User settings tabs\nUser settings tabs\nUser Settings is the home of almost every item in the program that can\nbe customized: file locations, keystroke assignments, translation options,\ndocument appearance, and display preferences, among many other things.\nThe options you can control in the 10 tabs of User settings are\ndescribed briefly below, and in detail in the relevant Help topics (see linked\npages).\nUser: Select main and user dictionaries, including master job\ndictionary; set paths for jobs and blocks folders; create new user formats and\nsettings files; import other settings; create new user.\nParagraphs: Paragraph format settings for question, answer,\nspeaker, by line, and other paragraph styles that you have created. Settings\ninclude margins, spacing, alignment, paragraph labels, label and text fonts.\n101\n447\n78 Eclipse Help\nDocument : The characteristics of the printed document such as\npage length, width, and margins, redacted text options, line number, text,\nheader, footer, paragraph number, font, textbox and timecode settings,\ncharacter spacing.\nEdit options: Setting âByâ formats, specifying spelling dictionaries,\nglobaling options (including which dictionary to use as the main one for\nsaving globals), detecting conflicts, word-stitch method, timed auto-backup,\naudio playback, keyboard customization and macros.\nDisplay options : Control how the job looks to you on the computer\nscreen while youâre editing, not how it will appear when printed (unless you\nuse the WYSIWYG option). Settings include hiding line numbers and leftmargin\nwhite space (so you can get more of the text on your screen), font for\nediting, zooming in and out (magnifying or shrinking the view), steno and\ncursor width, cursor width when using Hyperkeys, colors for various editing\nelements. Also control the notebar options where you can select whether or\nnot to have dictionary definitions displayed at the bottom of the notebar, the\nfont that is used in the notebar, whether phonetic or steno notes are\ndisplayed, and notebar timestamps.\nInput settings : Tell Eclipse how the notes are input, including what\nwriter you use and to what port it connects, the drive letter of your diskette\ndrive, and keyboard options. It includes the writer specialty strokes and\ncapitalize options for spell and stitch mode.\nRealtime settings include Flush delay, Pending translation display,\nFollow always, audio settings , turning Auto-brief on and off, and output\nformats.\nTranslation options include the speaker list, misstroke setup,\nphonetic untranslates, Boost, Boost Flow, and Translation Magic options.\nNumber processing options allow you to select the rules and\noptions for how you want your numbers to translate and appear. Using this\nvery powerful and sophisticated option greatly simplifies your numbers\nwriting.\nProgramming settings allow you to access your prefix and suffix\ntable; edit or view your phonetic table, the autoreplacement table, steno or\ntext regular expressions, typeover tracking, spelling expressions, common\nwords list, auto-brief theory rules, and file locations.\n434\n306\n122\n226\n487\n649\n244\n264\n826\nQuick Start Guide 79\n6.9.2 Document setup wizard\nDocument setup wizard\nUnder User Settings/User, there is a Document setup wizard\nbutton, which starts up a wizard that will walk you through setting up the\ndocument settings in Eclipse, including setting up page margins, headers,\nfooters, the text box, timecodes, page numbers, line numbers, and\nparagraph margins for questions, answers, colloquy, parentheticals and\ndefault paragraph types.\nYou can use this wizard anytime: when first setting up Eclipse, or\nanytime you want to adjust document settings. You can change any or all of\nthe settings as you work through the wizard.\nAs you are answering questions and making changes, a preview window\non the right side shows you exactly what the document will look like when\nit's printed. The wizard automates many of the processes. For example, when\nyou set a top and bottom margin and a number of lines, it figures out the\nline height from that. As you make adjustments to margins, the text box\nresizes.\nYou can define many of the measurements, such as the header margin,\nin terms of inches, centimeters, points or lines; and if you select lines, it\nfactors that into the calculation of the total height of the page when\ndetermining the line height.\n106\n80 Eclipse Help\nWhen setting up the paragraphs, you will be asked \"Do you want to\nspecify characters per line, or a right margin from the edge of the page?\" If\nyou specify a right margin, you will be given a measurement dialog and can\nchoose a distance. A characters-per-line right margin will be automatically\ncalculated from there based on your left margin, line number margin, etc.\nYou can move to a different section by clicking the a section heading.\nFor example, click on Page Numbers and Line Numbers to highlight it,\nthen hit Next or Enter, and it will move on to that section of the wizard.\nWhen you have gone through the Wizard, and hit the last \"Finished!\"\nbutton, you will get a message that states \"The document wizard is\ncomplete! If the document settings require further adjustments, go to User\nsettings and change the settings on the Paragraphs tab and the Document\ntab .\"\nWhen you hit the Done button, you will receive one final message that\nstates, \"This will apply these document settings permanently, and will affect\nall future documents created in this user. Are you sure?\" Choose yes or no.\nYou can try out the wizard, and cancel out of the process and your\nchanges will be discarded.

Reading notes (Creating a Eclipse note file).\n2. Translating notes (Creating a Eclipse text file).\n3. Editing the transcript.\n4. Adding supplementary transcript parts.\n5. Printing and creating other output\nLinks to Visualizers on Basic Transcript Production can be found here.\nReading notes\n113\n1086\n1058 998 118\n116 122\n951\n918\n916\n82 Eclipse Help\nReading notes is the process you use to get your steno notes into\nEclipse. When you read your notes into Eclipse, the notes are saved in a file\nwith a â.notâ file extension (e.g., ânewjob.notâ).\nWhen you translate note files on your computer, you select the â.notâ\nfile that you want to translate.\nPrior to reading notes for the first time, check your User\nsettings/Input to specify the source of your raw notes and the manner in\nwhich they are transferred from your writer to Eclipse. For details on setting\nup your Input settings, see Input tab help page.\nTo read notes, press Alt+I to open the Read notes dialog.\nThe display area on the left side of the window shows a list of raw note\nfiles available on the disk (or other source), along with each job fileâs size (in\nbytes) and creation date. When a raw note file in this area is highlighted, the\nfirst few folds of notes in that file appear in the display area on the right side\nof the dialog window (the âpreview areaâ).\nIn the Eclipse note file name field, type a name for the Eclipse note\nfile that you want to create from the file on the disk. If you choose an\nexisting note file name, the raw notes are appended to the end of the\nexisting note file. Use the Browse button to look in other folders. If you do\nnot enter a name in this field, a prompt will appear, requiring you to enter a\nname before proceeding.\nIf you back up your notes directly from the writer drive to archive\nfolders or drives, you can use the New source.. button on the read notes\ndialog to select a different location where your notes are stored.\n226 226\nQuick Start Guide 83\nClick the Read button to start the read process. The stroke count\nappears to the right of the Read button during this process. If you have\nchecked the Open option, when the job has been read or transferred to the\ncomputer, the note file just created or appended to will open. The Read\nnotes dialog remains open so you can continue to read jobs if necessary.\nTo open and review the contents of a Eclipse note file, press Shift+F7.\nA standard Windows file dialog displays the available note files in your jobs\nfolder.\nTo open a file, double-click it. (Keyboard command--If you prefer to\nleave your hands on the keyboard, press Shift+Tab, press the first letter of\nthe file you want until it is highlighted, then press Enter.) You can select and\nopen multiple files.\nTranslating notes\nWhen you translate notes, Eclipse uses your main dictionary and any\nother dictionaries you specify to generate a text file from a note file. The\nresulting Eclipse text file has the extension â.eclâ (e.g. ânewjob.eclâ), and is\nplaced in your Jobs folder, setup in User Settings/User/Advanced.\nTo translate a note file,\n1. Press Alt+T to open the Translate notes dialog. Be sure that the\nRealtime and Virtual Realtime option boxes in the Translation dialog\nscreen are not checked.\n2. Click the Notes button to specify the note file you want to translate. Once\nyou select a file for translation, the filename appears to the right of the\nNotes button. (If a note file is active when you select the translate\ncommand, the Translate notes window will automatically specify the\nactive note file.)\n3. By default, Eclipse will create a text file with the same name as the note\nfile (e.g., translating newjob.not will create a text file with the name\nnewjob.ecl). The text file is also placed in the same folder as the note file.\nTo specify a different name for the text file, or to change its location, click\nthe Text button.\n4. The Dictionaries area lists the dictionaries that will be used to\ntranslate the note file. Click on the Dictionaries button, and use the Add,\nRemove and Change buttons to specify translation dictionaries.\n5. To maximize translation speed, check the Quick tran option. If you want\nto begin editing the document while it is still being translated, check the\nTran and edit option. (Translation in the Tran & edit mode proceeds\nmore slowly because it is displaying screens of the text while translating\nin the background.)\n6. If you want to see your translation statistics while any job translates,\nplace a check in the Show statistics box.\n7. Press Enter or Click OK to begin the translation.\n134\n84 Eclipse Help\nNote on Connection Magic: When you are translating a file, whether\ndoing Realtime, or Tran and Edit, you have the option of using Connection\nMagic to do shared editing over an internet connection with any number of\nother users. The Connection Magic dialog displays the name of the editing\njob, all the users logged into the session, and any messages sent by the\npeople logged in. For details on setting up Connection Magic, see the\nConnection Magic help file .\nOpening a Translated Text File\nTo open a text file, press Alt+E, or the Production menu/Open text.\nAs with note files, you can select and open multiple text files.\nEditing represents the bulk of producing a transcript and Eclipse has\nmany features to streamline editing and make it as efficient as possible. The\nEditing a Transcript section of help provides detailed information on\nediting.\nYou can perform any editing task from the keyboard using standard\nkeyboard shortcuts, or you can use HyperkeysâEclipseâs single-key editing\nmode (when using the default set of Hyperkeys that comes with your\nsoftware you can turn Hyperkeys on and off by pressing Alt+Z, or the Edit\nmenu/Hyperkeys).\nComplete tables of keyboard shortcuts and Hyperkeys are located in the\nReference Guide . After installing Eclipse, you can go to the documentation\nfolder and open the âEclipse Quick Guide.pdf,â which contains a printable\nkeyboard layout.\nFixing Mistakes: Undo (the \"Oops\" key)\nOne of the most important commands to know might be Undo â it\nundoes, one by one, the last editing steps you entered in a paragraph. For\nexample, if you deleted two words (âatâ and then âwhenâ), then realized you\nshouldnât have, give the undo command twiceâthe first time it will undo the\ndeletion of âwhenâ (the most recent editing step) and the second will undo\nthe deletion of âatâ (the second most recent edit).\nEclipse can undo up to ten editing steps except commands that add or\nremove paragraphs.\nThe Speed key is Ctrl+Z. You can also use the Edit menu/Undo.\n6.9.4.1 Creating A File\nCREATING A FILE\n532\n694\n770\nQuick Start Guide 85\nIf you wish to produce a transcript from steno that you have written on a\nsteno machine, you first need to read notes , and then translate\nnotes .\nYou can also produce a transcript by doing realtime .\nCreating a file in Eclipse (such as for a block file, dictionary, or\nsteno file).\nCreating a new user.\n6.9.4.2 Notes Files\nNOTES FILES\nRELATES TO: Read Notes , Translate Notes ,\nOpen Notes .\nNote files are raw steno files. Usually, they are created by reading notes from\nyour steno machine into Eclipse. Even after you translate a note file, the raw note\nfile itself will remain. A realtime job will also produce a note file. Note files have\nan .NOT extension , and can be retranslated.\nWhen a note file is open, you can quickly translate it by pressing Alt+T. You\nwill be taken to the Translate Notes dialog, with the current note file already selected.\nAlt+M will toggle Translate Mode on and off. When Translate Mode is active, a\ntranslated version of the raw steno will appear at right. When it is off, you will see\nphonetics instead.\nThe following Eclipse editing actions can also be done on note files:\nÂ· Moving around, using the applicable basic cursor movements .\nÂ· You can perform globals from within a note file, just as you would in a text\nfile .\nÂ· Block operations can be performed on note files, allowing you to quickly merge\nor split them.\nÂ· You can search a note file. Enter the desired steno into the steno emulator .\nÂ· You can go to a stroke or fold number.\nÂ· You can add new steno outlines to a note file by using the Add Dictionary\nEntry command (Ctrl+D). The steno emulator will appear, and any steno\n230\n269\n483\n1036\n108\n230 269\n232\n230\n269\n483\n971\n269\n312\n326\n694\n392\n320 893\n988\n173 893\n86 Eclipse Help\nstrokes you enter will be added to the end of the note file. This allows you to\ncreate and add to steno files without having a machine present, perhaps for\neducational or testing purposes.\nVISUALIZERS:\nDa - Read Notes\nM4 - Auto-Magic Note Files\n6.9.4.3 Open Text\nOpen Text\nAlt+E\nFile (or Production)/Open text\nRELATES TO: Opening a File .\nOpens a file dialog from which you can select a text file for\nviewing.\nYou can also create a new text file by entering a new filename. This\nmethod of creating a new text file is most often used to create block files\n. If you want to create a transcript from existing steno, you need to read\nnotes and then translate notes , or start a realtime job.\n6.9.5 Moving Around in the Transcript\nMoving Around in the Transcript\nMoving the Cursor\nWhen editing documents, the cursor position is indicated by a blinking cursor.\nYou can customize the cursorâs width, so depending on the width you select, it can\nappear as a vertical line or a rectangle.\nWhen using the standard keyboard setup, the arrow keys are used to perform\nmost cursor movements. In Hyperkeys, basic cursor movements are located on the\nright side of the keyboard.\n1036\n969 694\n1036\n548\n230 269 483\nQuick Start Guide 87\nYou can also move the cursor via the Move menu, but it is far quicker to use\nkeyboard shortcuts, which allow you to keep your hands on the keyboard. The Move\nmenu lists the shortcuts next to the corresponding menu item and can serve as an\nonline reference card until you know the commands.\nWhen editing a text file with the steno window open, you can left-click anywhere\nin the steno window, and the cursor will jump to the position that would track to that\nstroke.\nText files are the only documents in Eclipse in which a cursor appears. Dictionary\nand note files do not have a text cursor. Instead, highlighted entries indicate the\ncurrent position. However, many cursor movement keystrokes result in analogous\nmovements in these document types. For example, pressing Alt+Home moves the\ncursor to the top of the page in text documents, and highlights the top stroke of the\nfold in note files. When a dictionary or note file is active, the Move menu lists only\nthose movement commands that are available for the active file type.\nMovement Standard keys Hyperkeys\nLeft one word (left arrow) J\nRight one word (right arrow) L\nUp one line (up arrow) I\nDown one line (down arrow) K\nLeft one character Ctrl+(left arrow) Shift+J\nRight one character Ctrl+(right arrow) Shift+L\nUp one paragraph Ctrl+(up arrow) Y\nDown one paragraph Ctrl+(down arrow) H\nPage up/Backward 1 page Page Up Shift+Y\nPage down/Forward 1 page Page Down Shift+H\nHome (start of line) Home [\nEnd (of line) End ]\nGo to page/line no.

The Go to.. dialog\nappears.\n1. Enter the page number in the Page field.\n2. If you want to go to a particular line on the page, enter the line number in the\nLine field.\n3. Press Enter or click OK. The cursor will move to the beginning of the selected\npage and line if a line number has been entered.\nGo to a specific timecode\nIn addition to the page and line number, you can type in and jump to a specific\ntimecode. You can omit as much of the right side of the timecode as you like. For\nexample, you can type in 14:30. You do not have to type in 14:30:00:00. You can\neven just type in 9, for example, to go to 9 o'clock even.\nMoving among trouble spots (Scanning)\nYou can also move the cursor using a scan, which moves the cursor to the next\noccurrence of a specific type of editing trouble spot, such as a conflict or untranslate.\nVarious types of scans are listed on the Move menu, under the Scan and Reverse\nscan items. The most common is scanning to a trouble spot (Ctrl+T). To learn more\nabout a particular type of scan, highlight it on the menu, then press F1 (Help).\nScanning is described in Editing a Transcript: Scan to Trouble Sports .\n6.9.6 Globals\nGlobals\nGlobals allow you to define or redefine steno from within the transcript.\n339\nQuick Start Guide 89\nTo perform a simple one-stroke global, issue the Global command (Ctrl+G),\ntype the text definition for the selected stroke, and press Enter. The change is\napplied from the point of the global to the end of the document (by default - you can\nchange this) and the entry is added to your main dictionary. (This is the default\nsetting but you can change the default dictionary location for globals in your User\nsettings.)\nWhen you issue the Global command, you can also select options in the\nGlobaling dialog window that allow you to perform more complex globals. For\nexample, you can select additional strokes to create a multi-stroke entry, and you can\nspecify alternate dictionaries.\nHere is a simple one-stroke global. The steno TPHO is commonly the word âno.â\nSuppose you translated a job and got the following:\nSince the steno TPHO is not currently in your dictionary, Eclipse doesnât know\nwhat to do with it, and simply dumps it into your job in its raw steno form. You will\nwant to correct it in the job, and also add this word to your main dictionary.\nTo perform the global:\n1. Put the cursor on TPHO.\n2. Press Hyperkey G, or standard key Ctrl+G. The Globaling window will appear.\nThe Globaling window\n3. In the title bar of the window, the steno you selected, TPHO, will appear. (If\nanything different appears, press the Esc key and start over.)\n90 Eclipse Help\n4. Notice the list of words that Eclipse suggests. This appears if you have checked\nthe Global Magic box in User settings/Edit.\n5. Press 2 to select ânoâ. (You cannot use your down arrow, because any key you\nhit other than the numbers 1-0 will close the list.)\n6. Press Enter.\nAll four instances of TPHO will change to the word ânoâ, like this:\nNotice that Eclipse capitalizes the word when appropriate, and correctly adjusts\nall the punctuation around the various instances of the word ânoâ. The word has also\nbeen added to your main dictionary; the next time you translate a job, TPHO will\ntranslate as the word ânoâ rather than the raw steno.\nIf the word you want does not appear on the list, just type it into the space, and\npress Enter. As soon as you begin typing, the list disappears.\nIf you want to confirm that a word was added to your main dictionary, put the\ncursor on the word, then press F9 followed by Enter. Eclipse will take you to your\nmain dictionary and highlight that entry.\nFor more information, see Editing a Transcript: Global , or highlight Global on\nthe Edit menu and press F1.\nFor all the visualizers dealing with Globaling, go here .\n6.9.7 Marking Text\nMarking Text\nYou can highlight a selection of text (sometimes called block marking)\nand then apply editing commands that affect the entire marked area. For\nexample, you could mark a section of text and then press the hyphen key (-)\nto stitch the selection of words with hyphens (e.g. run-of-the-mill).\nYou can also cut (Ctrl+X), copy (Ctrl+C), and paste (Ctrl+V) marked\ntext (standard Windows functions). For more information on working with\nmarked blocks of text, see Editing .\n336\n326\n924\n302\nQuick Start Guide 91\nTo mark a selection of text, position your text cursor at the beginning or\nend of the selection you want to mark, then press F7. This turns on the\nblock-marking feature. Any cursor movement keys that you subsequently\npress will mark text (e.g., press the right arrow key to mark text from the\ncurrent position to the beginning of the next word).\nYou can also mark text using standard Windows methods, such as\nclicking-and-dragging over text with your mouse, or holding the Shift key\nand pressing any cursor-movement key (known as âShift-clickâ).\n6.9.8 Formatting Paragraphs\nFormatting Paragraphs\nIn Eclipse, every paragraph is associated with a particular format type.\nThe format includes information on margins, font, labels (e.g., Q. and A.),\nautomatic punctuation, and other characteristics. All these characteristics are\nset in User settings/Paragraphs tab (Alt+U). Each format listed in the\nParagraph field contains its own settings on this tab. Your default paragraph\ntype is indicated by the word (default) next to the type.\n92 Eclipse Help\nWhen you edit these settings, you may apply them to just the current\ndocument or to your permanent user settings (Master format). If you apply\nthem to your permanent user settings any future documents you create will\nuse the new settings. You can also define paragraph formats in your\ndictionary, so that formats are automatically applied during translation.\nWhen you edit a document, you can change a paragraph from one\nformat to another (e.g., change a question paragraph to an answer\nparagraph) and insert a format to split a paragraph or start a new paragraph.\nYou can do this by clicking on the paragraph-type button (or pressing the F8\nkey) on the left side of the screen and selecting the paragraph type desired\nfrom the dialog.\nYou can determine the current format of a paragraph from the square\nbuttons that appear down the left side of a text document window. The\nletters on these buttons correspond to the first letter of the paragraph\nformat. For example, âQâ indicates a question paragraph, âAâ indicates an\nanswer paragraph, and âSâ indicates a speaker paragraph. You can also\nchange or edit paragraph features by clicking this button. To access the same\ndialog using the keyboard, place your cursor in the paragraph and press F8.\nAdditional paragraph commands are located on the Format menu. The\neffect of these commands depends on your cursor location. If your cursor is\nlocated anywhere within the body of the paragraph when you select a\nparagraph format, a new paragraph of the selected type is created at the\ncursor position. Text preceding the cursor position remains with the current\nparagraph. If your cursor is located on the paragraphâs label when you select\na format, the entire paragraph is changed to the selected format. (To move\nthe cursor to a paragraph label, click on the label or hit the Home key twice.)\nSee the Paragraphs tab help file , for more information on paragraph\nformats.\nHitting the Enter key when the cursor is at the end of the document\nwill make a new paragraph of the type you have designated as the default\nparagraph.\n6.9.9 Additional Transcript Elements\nAdditional Transcript Elements\nIn addition to the body of the transcript, transcripts often contain many\nelements such as title and certificate pages, headers and footers, line and\npage numbers, indexes, and graphic boxes. You control many of these\nelements through block files, print commands, and User settings on the\nDocument tab.\n447\nQuick Start Guide 93\nÂ· Block files\nBlock files are Eclipse text files such as title and certificate pages that\ncontain reusable information, and which you can automatically insert into a\ntranscript. You may be more familiar with these files when they are called\nâincludes,â âmerge documents,â or âstandard pages.â Eclipse allows you to\nincrease the efficiency of using these documents by allowing you to insert\nfill-in-the-blank lines (form fields) in these block files to indicate information\nthat changes in an otherwise consistently similar document. Examples are\nattorney and deponent names, dates, locations, and jurisdictions.\nYou can also create block files containing lists of information, and then\nuse these files as shortcuts when filling in blanks.\nTo create a block file\nConfirm your blocks path (check at User\nsettings/Advanced /Blocks) and browse to that folder if it is not your jobs\nfolder. Open a file (Alt+E). An Open file dialog opens.\nType a name for the block file in the File name field.\nPress Enter or click Open.\nAn alert box will appear, stating the file name you typed does not exist\nand asking if you want to create the file. Click Yes.\nA text file is created and opened in Eclipse. You can create the fileâs\ncontent using any of the available text editing methods.\nYou create the content of the block file using the same editing\ntechniques for transcriptsâtype the text you want and apply formatting\ncommands to achieve the desired appearance.\nYou can manually insert a block file into a transcript, or you can insert\nblock files during translation.\nTo manually insert a block file, position the cursor at the point where\nyou want to insert the file and press Alt+R. This opens a file dialog window,\nin which you can select the file you want to insert.\nTo insert a block file into the document during translation using a\ndictionary entry (called an autoinclude), use the following syntax\n{<filename}. When you translate your notes, the file is automatically\nincluded.\n548\n59\n94 Eclipse Help\nÂ· Print Commands\nPrint commands are hidden commands or messages that you insert into\nyour document to control various aspects of your transcript, such as page\nnumbering, automatic indexing, and even comments for yourself or a scopist.\nThe commands themselves donât appear on your printout (except for\ncomment lines which print when using draft mode) and they appear in your\ndisplay only if you turn on Print commands in the Display options, either in\nyour User settings/Display tab (mark the Print commands checkbox) or with\nthe Display toolbar button.\nPrint commands do not appear when you display a transcript in\nâWYSIWYGâ mode except when the cursor is on a print command (see\nWYSIWYG? below).\nTo insert a print command use Alt+N. The Insert Print Command\ndialog opens, which contains a list of available print commands and an\nAdditional info area that provides information on the specific command\nselected. For example, the area may instruct you to âFill in information after\ninserting print command,â or it may provide a âValueâ field for entering data\nabout the selected command.\nWhen you click OK, the selected print command is inserted in the\ndocument, immediately before the current paragraph. If you have multiple\nlines of text, such as index lines and comment lines, you may want to specify\nthe right margin in User settings/Document/Advanced.\n362\nQuick Start Guide 95\nThe individual print commands are discussed in this manual where their\nfunction is relevant.\nÂ· Document formatting\nThe Document tab is located in User settings (Alt+U) and contains\nsettings for document elements such as page number format and position,\npage and line dimensions, and text box options. You can apply changes\neither to the current document only (select the Current document radio\nbutton) or save them to the Master format so that you can apply them to\nfuture documents.\nÂ· Printing and other output\nOnce you have completed the editing process you can create several\ntypes of output, including âhard copyâ printing, ASCII files, and RTF (Rich\nText Format) files. To create any of these output types, the document must\nbe open and active.\nTo print a document, use Alt+O. From the Print dialog, select the\nnumber of copies to print and a page range to print. Before printing, in File\nmenu/Print setup you can select your printer, adjust its properties, and\nchose network settings.\nTo create an ASCII file, select Output to ASCII from the Production\nmenu (Shift+Alt+O).\nFrom the Create ASCII dialog, you can use the Style presets to select\namong various ASCII styles (including Standard (page image) and\nSummation) and a page range.\n434\n600\n96 Eclipse Help\nOther Output options\nOther output options include RTF/CRE, Raw Text, and Bridge. For\ndetails, see the Production help section.\n6.9.10 WYSIWYG\nWYSIWYG\nYou can view documents exactly as they will print using the option\ncalled âWYSIWYGâ mode (pronounced âwizzywigâââwhat-you-see-is-whatyou-\ngetâ). You can also view nonprinting elements, such as print commands\nin a transcript. To view or hide various elements of a document, click the\nDisplay properties toolbar button. This opens the Display dialog (User\nsettings/Display).\nTo view the document the way it will print, click WYSIWYG. Eclipse\nwill first display a warning message, âThis will change your display settings\nto match your printout and will undo any changes you have made to these\nsettings. Continue?â You can choose not to display the message in the future.\n600\nQuick Start Guide 97\nTo view a document in a font other than the one in which you will print\nit, click the Editing Font button. This opens the Font dialog box in which\nyou can select a different font or font attributes (such as bold, underscore or\nitalics) for the display. This is called the âediting fontâ because it only affects\nthe screen display and does not show what the document will actually print\nlike. If you have a different font selected for editing than will be used for\nprinting, when you press the WYSIWYG button the editing font will be\ndisabled.\nThe WYSIWYG mode allows you to adjust paragraph margins, boxes,\ntabs, and other formatting elements for the file. The rulers at the top of a\ndocument window contain margin and tab buttons that you can click-anddrag\nwith the mouse. You can alternately adjust many page elements (e.g.,\npage number position) from the User settings/Document tab. If you move\nthe User settings dialog box so that your document is visible in the\nbackground, you can watch the document change as you make your\nadjustments. Note that if you select certain options on the Display tab, you\nwill no longer be in the WYSIWYG mode.\n6.9.11 Connection Magic\nConnection Magic\nConnection Magic is the generic term for the Advantage Software\nconnection infrastructure that works through any network â local or internet.\nWhen you are translating a file, whether doing Realtime, or Tran and Edit,\nyou can use Connection Magic to connect with any number of users, to do\nshared editing, or to share your document with clients and others using\nBridge mobile, over an internet connection or a local network. You can set up\na portable wifi router, to set up a local connection that doesn't rely on the\ninternet. You can also use Connectify to turn your PC into a wifi hotspot so\nyou can connect to nearby devices and even share your internet connection.\nAs of Version 10, Connectify is built-in to Eclipse.\nÂ· To use Connection Magic, you must be connected to the internet or a\nLAN (Local Area Network), or use Connectify. Details on using\nConnection Magic on a LAN are in the Reference section .\nÂ· To begin a shared editing session with a scopist or other user, you\nmust have a document on the screen.\nÂ· If you choose output to Bridge Mobile , you will decide when you\nstart the session whether you will use the internet or LAN.\nÂ· For details on using Connection Magic and Shared, or Team Editing,\nsee the Connection Magic and Team Editing help topic.\n723\n1204\n532\n98 Eclipse Help\nÂ· Instructions on how to set up Connection Magic are found in the\nConnection Magic Settings dialog 913 help topic.\nUsers and User Settings 99\n7 Users and User Settings\nUsers and User Settings\nA \"user\" in Eclipse is a complete set of user preferences, including\neverything on all ten tabs of User Settings , as well as the choices you've\nmade in specific dialogs.\nEventually, you will probably want to have more than one set of user\nsettings for yourself. For example, if you work in three different environments\nthat have three different looks for their documents, you can create a \"user\"\nfor each. When you go to work, select your user for today's client, and the\ncorrect page formatting for that client will automatically be used.\nTo make a new combination of settings, set up any different\nparagraph/document settings, different dictionaries, different display\nsettings, different translation options for a \"user.\" Then hit the \"Save\nsettings\" button on the User Settings/User tab and enter a name for this\n\"user.\"\nNote that creating a different set of user settings for yourself is different\nfrom creating a new user. A \"new user\" is a person, and not a group of\nsettings; so once you have created a user for yourself you probably wonât\never need to \"create a new user.\"\nHowever, if you do need a new user (perhaps so someone else can use\nyour computer and have his or her own settings files, or if you are working\nwith a scopist), then use User Settings/User tab/Create New User. This\nbutton starts the New User Setup Wizard, which walks you through the\nprocess. The wizard creates a new user file, a new (empty) main dictionary,\nand a folder for storing job-related files. For the difference between Saving\nSetting and Creating a New User, see the Visualizer.\nFor more on Users, including several Visualizers, see the help topic\nWorking With Users\n7.1 User Settings\nUser Settings\nAlt+U\nThe Settings toolbar button, speed key Alt+U, or the Production menu,\nUser settings option opens the User settings dialog.\n99\n112\n108\n100 Eclipse Help\nUser Settings is the home of almost every item in the program that can\nbe customized: file locations, keystroke assignments, translation options,\ndocument appearance, and display preferences, among many other things.\nThe options you can control in the 10 tabs of User settings are\ndescribed briefly below, and in detail in the relevant Help topics (see linked\npages).\nÂ· User: Select main and user dictionaries, including master job\ndictionary; set paths for jobs and blocks folders; create new user\nformats and settings files; import other settings; create new user.\nÂ· Paragraphs: Paragraph format settings for question, answer,\nspeaker, by line, and other paragraph styles that you have created.\nSettings include margins, spacing, alignment, paragraph labels, label\nand text fonts.\nÂ· Document : The characteristics of the printed document such as\npage length, width, and margins, redacted text options, line number,\ntext, header, footer, paragraph number, font, textbox and timecode\nsettings, character spacing.\nÂ· Edit options: Setting âByâ formats, specifying spelling dictionaries,\nglobaling options (including which dictionary to use as the main one\nfor saving globals), detecting conflicts, word-stitch method, timed\nauto-backup, audio playback, keyboard customization and macros.\n101\n447\n434\n306\nUsers and User Settings 101\nÂ· Display options : Control how the job looks to you on the computer\nscreen while youâre editing, not how it will appear when printed\n(unless you use the WYSIWYG option). Settings include hiding line\nnumbers and left-margin white space (so you can get more of the\ntext on your screen), font for editing, zooming in and out (magnifying\nor shrinking the view), steno and cursor width, cursor width when\nusing Hyperkeys, colors for various editing elements. Also control the\nnotebar options where you can select whether or not to have\ndictionary definitions displayed at the bottom of the notebar, the font\nthat is used in the notebar, whether phonetic or steno notes are\ndisplayed, and notebar timestamps.\nÂ· Input settings : Tell Eclipse how the notes are input, including\nwhat writer you use and to what port it connects, the drive letter of\nyour diskette drive, and keyboard options. It includes the writer\nspecialty strokes and capitalize options for spell and stitch mode.\nÂ· Realtime settings include Flush delay, Pending translation display,\nFollow always, audio settings , turning Auto-brief on and off, and\noutput formats.\nÂ· Translation options include the speaker list, misstroke setup,\nphonetic untranslates, and Translation Magic options.\nÂ· Number processing options allow you to select the rules and\noptions for how you want your numbers to translate and appear.\nUsing this very powerful and sophisticated option greatly simplifies\nyour numbers writing.\nÂ· Programming settings allow you to access your prefix and suffix\ntable; edit or view your phonetic table, the autoreplacement table,\nsteno or text regular expressions, typeover tracking, spelling\nexpressions, common words list, auto-brief theory rules, and file\nlocations.\n7.2 User Tab\nUser Tab\nRELATES TO: Working With Users .\nThe User tab of User Settings allows you to create and select different users,\nshare settings with other users, and set general preferences.\n122\n226\n487\n649\n244\n264\n826\n108\n102 Eclipse Help\nUser Name\nUser Name is a text description of the user. This is the name that appears in\nthe Eclipse title bar. It is useful to set this to something descriptive, so you can tell\nwhich user you are in simply by glancing at the title bar. This field can be edited as\ntext; however, you will not see the change in the title bar until you Save Settings ,\nor leave and re-enter the user.\nUser File is the actual name of the .INI file. It is the name that appears in the\nlist of users when you Load Settings . It cannot be edited. To rename a user, use\nthe File Manager .\nLoading and Saving Users\nThe Load Settings button allows you to select a different user. Select the\ndesired user from the Users dialog, just as you do when you enter the program.\nThe Save Settings button will manually save any changes you make to your\nUser Settings. You will be asked to enter a filename: the default filename will be the\nname of the current user. Accept the default filename to make changes in an existing\nfile. You may also create a new user by typing a different filename.\nImporting and Exporting Settings\nSee Visualizer\n102\n102\n677\n108\nUsers and User Settings 103\nThe Import Settings and Export Settings buttons allow you to selectively\nshare settings with another user. For example, a firm could distribute a settings file of\nits standard paragraph and document settings, which its reporters could import\nwithout changing any of their other preferences. Also, Advantage Software premakes\nsettings files for a variety of special purposes (captioning, voicewriting, realtime\nediting, etc.).\nTo create a settings file to export selected User Settings:\n1. Click Export Settings. The User settings transfer dialog will appear:\n2. There are ten categories of user settings that can be shared. Mark the checkboxes\nof the items you want to export. You may click the All or None buttons to\nquickly check or uncheck all boxes.\n3. When you have checked the items you wish to export, click OK.\n4. The \"Save File...\" file dialog will appear. Type the name you wish to give the\nsettings file.\nThis process will create a .SET file, which can then be imported by another user\n(either another person, or a different user profile for yourself) via the Import Settings\nbutton. You can import user settings from other Eclipse users.\nThe file can also serve as a backup, from which the selected user settings can be\nrestored.\nHyperkeys that are assigned to macros are not converted; Hyperkeys that are\nassigned to standard commands will be imported.\nThe following procedure overwrites the user settings that are currently loaded in\nEclipse.\n969\n104 Eclipse Help\n1. Press Alt+U to open the User settings dialog.\n2. Press the Save settings button and enter a new name if you want to create a\nnew user format to receive the settings.\n3. On the User tab, click the Import button.\n4. The Open File dialog appears. Choose the settings file to import and click OK or\nhit Enter.\n5. The User settings transfer dialog will appear. Use the checkboxes to select the\nitems you want to import. You may select any combination of items that are\navailable; you do not have to import everything in the file. Also, only items that\nwere exported may be imported, so some boxes may be grayed out.)\n6. Click OK.\nAfter importing the file, your User Settings will be changed to match the\ncontents of the .SET file. This will overwrite your existing settings, in the areas you\nchose to import.\nIf Merge settings where possible is checked, the information in the .SET file\nyou are importing will merge with your existing user settings. If not, the .SET file you\nare importing will override existing settings. This pertains mostly to Prefixes/Suffixes,\nAutoreplacements, and Metadictionary . Phonetics will not merge.\nIf you want the option to keep entries you already have for items in the\nProgramming tab (like the Metadictionary), turn on the Merge settings where\npossible option, and it will merge the settings you're importing, rather than simply\nreplacing one with the other. If it detects that a new entry would overwrite an old\none, you will be prompted with a â... Replace this instance?â message.\nYou can choose Yes to replace the old entry with the new one or No to keep the\nold one.\nWhen you click OK, the selected fileâs settings are imported into the current\nEclipse user file (*.ini file), replacing the current settings.\n850\nUsers and User Settings 105\nGlobal settings\nIf you export some settings into a file called GLOBAL.SET in your JOBS folder,\nthen those settings will be loaded every time you load any .ini file that uses that jobs\nfolder. This is useful if you have created a group of settings that you wish to be\napplied to all of your various .ini files and you don't want to have to go in and\nmanually import them into each one.\nFor example, if you frequently edit macros or keystrokes, you may wish to create\na global.set file that contains ONLY your keyboard settings. If you did that, then you\nwould be assured that no matter which .ini file you loaded, it would always use the\nkeyboard set from the global.set file.\nCaution: If you accidentally create a global.set file that contains document\nsettings, for example, then any differences in the document settings of your .ini files\nwill be wiped out as soon as you load them up.\nThe global.set file can be deleted or moved or given to a friend just as any other\nfile can.\nDictionaries button\nTo specify current dictionaries, go to User Settings/User and click the\nDictionaries button. The Dictionaries dialog box opens.\nBy default, the Main dictionary for the user (HW in the example above) will be\nset. You can select a different Main dictionary, a Job dictionary (which takes\nprecedence over jobname.dix dictionaries), and as many supplemental user\ndictionaries as you like (for example, if you have dictionaries for specific fields, such\nas medical or engineering terms). To indicate whether a dictionary should be applied\nin translation, highlight the dictionary's name, and mark the Use in translation\ncheckbox above the OK button, by either clicking on the box with your mouse, or\nusing the tab/shift+tab keys and the spacebar to select it.\n106 Eclipse Help\nIn the example, the Job dictionary is activated, and the medical dictionary is\nnot. (The Main dictionary is always active by default.) Dictionaries not selected for\ntranslation are available for globaling entries into, but will not be used in translation.\nTo change a dictionary, highlight the name of the dictionary you want to change\nand click Change. You will get a standard Open file dialog that you can use to browse\nyour folders and choose the file you want. By default, the window shows the\ndictionary files in your job folder. Use the window to browse your folders; when you\nfind the dictionary file you want to use, you can either select it and then click OK, or\ndouble-click on it.\nDictionaries are stored with the path name, so you do not need to keep them in\nyour jobs folder. For example, you could make a folder called âDictâ in your jobs folder\nand put your dictionaries there, and a dictionary will show up on this list as\nDict\\DixName. In situations where the system is unable to find a dictionary (for\nexample, if you use an unusual path and you send a job and dictionary to a scopist\nwho doesn't have the same setup) the software will look in the same folder as the\ndocument, then it will look in the jobs folder.\nOnce you specify a dictionary, its name will appear in the field. Be sure to\nactivate those dictionaries you want Eclipse to use automatically when translating a\nnote file.\nClick OK and you will be back at the User tab.\nSave the settings with the Save settings button.\nDocument Setup Wizard\nThe Document Setup Wizard is a quick and easy way to set up your Paragraphs\ntab and Document tab . To use the wizard:\n1. Click the Document Setup Wizard button. The Document setup wizard dialog\nwill appear:\n447 434\nUsers and User Settings 107\n2. Click Next to begin the wizard.\n3. You will be asked to adjust a series of items. Depending on the nature of the\nmeasurement you are changing, you may be offered different ways to enter the\ndata:\no Adjust button. Click this button, and the Measure dialog will appear. Enter the\ndesired measurement into the text box, or use the spin control to make\nchanges. Also, select the desired unit of measure from the option buttons at\nleft.\no Option buttons. Select your choice from the options given.\no List. Select your choice from the options given.\no Text. Enter the information requested.\n4. When you enter a measurement, the sample transcript at right will update to show\nyou the effects of the change. You may try different measurements to see which\nyou like best.\n5. When you are satisfied with a measurement, click OK or press Enter. You will be\ntaken to the next item in that category.\n6. When you are finished with that category, the wizard will show the list of\ncategories. Click Next to start the next category.\n108 Eclipse Help\n7. When you have entered all data, click \"Finished!\", and then click Next.\n8. You will be asked to finalize your choices by clicking Done. You must do this, or\nyour changes will not be saved.\n9. Your user settings will be updated to reflect the choices you made in the wizard.\nIf you make a mistake, want to change something later, or if you want to enter\nsomething that isn't in the list of choices, enter the closest option you can find, and\nthen change it later on the Document tab or the Paragraphs tab .\nOther Options\nThe Create New User button will create an entirely new user profile. See the\npage on creating a new user for an explanation of the difference between Create\nNew User and Save Settings.\nThe Dictionaries button opens the Dictionaries dialog , where you can assign\nyour Main, Job, and User dictionaries on a permanent basis.\nThe Advanced button opens the Advanced User Settings dialog, where folder\nassignments and other advanced changes can be made.\nVISUALIZERS:\nB1 - Loading and Switching Settings\nC5 - Save Settings vs. Create New User Format\nB1a - How to Undo Changes to User Settings (if not yet saved)\nC6 - How to Delete a User Format\nJ3a - SET files\nB2 - Document Setup\nB3a - Wizard Adjusts Paragraphs\nB2a - Paragraph Setup\nC2 - Blocks Folder\n7.3 Working with Users\nWorking With Users\nRELATES TO: User tab .\nA \"user\" in Eclipse is a complete set of user preferences.

For example, if you\nwork in three different environments that have three different looks for their\ndocuments, you can create a user for each. When you go to work, you need only\nselect your user for today's client; the correct page formatting for that client will\nautomatically be used.\nScope of Users\nAny time you make a change in User Settings, it applies to that user only. This\nallows you to use different paragraph/document settings, different dictionaries,\ndifferent display settings, different translation options in any combination.\nCreating A New User\nIf you want to create a new user for yourself, do not use the Create New User\nbutton on the User tab . Instead, click Save Settings, and give the user a\ndifferent name. This will create a copy of your existing user; this means the new user\nwill have your main dictionary, folders, and other options. You may then work with\neach user independently.\nA user refers to a person, and not a group of settings; so once you have created\na user for yourself you probably wonât ever need to create a new user. However, if you\ndo need a new user (perhaps so someone else can use your computer and have his or\nher own settings files), then use User Settings/User tab/Create New User. This\nbutton starts the New User Setup Wizard, which walks you through the process.\nThe wizard creates a new user file, a new (empty) main dictionary, and a folder for\nstoring job-related files.\nWhen you click the Create new user button, a warning message will remind you\nto use this only for a whole new user.\n101\n110 Eclipse Help\nThe wizard will prompt you to enter identifying information and select a\nnickname. Note that while the wizard asks for a first and last name, you can enter any\ntwo words to identify the user, such as âJohn Smithâ When you click the Finish\nbutton on the wizard window, the new user settings file, dictionary, and file folder are\ncreated, each having the nickname you selected in the wizard (for example, if the\nnickname used for âJohn Smithâ were âJS,â the folder would be named JS, the\ndictionary would be JS.dix, and the settings file would be JS.ini). The folder created is\nthe default folder for storing jobs and blocks and also contains the new dictionary. The\ndictionary is an empty file into which you can import another dictionary, if desired, or\nbuild from scratch. The new userâs settings file (the â.iniâ file) has Eclipseâs default\nsettings.\nOnce the new user is successfully created, it becomes the current user. To\nswitch to a different user, go to User settings (Alt+U) and load a different user\nsettings file.\nSave Settings\nWhen you change settings in the User settings dialog, you can immediately\nsave the altered settings by clicking the Save button. This opens a dialog, in which\nthe current user settings file is listed in the Enter a filename field.\nIf you want to save these settings to that file, press Enter (or click OK).\nIf you want to save these settings to a new file, type a file name in the space\nand press Enter. This new user file is saved as an .ini file and becomes the active\none.\nIf you make a mistake in your user settings and you haven't saved them yet,\nyou can go to User settings/User/Advanced and hit the Revert settings button,\nwhich will reload your last .ini file without saving the changes.\nTo organize users, you can use underscores to group users. If have a Court.ini,\nyou can also create Court_County, Court_State, and Court_Federal and Eclipse allows\nyou to collapse and expand this list of users.\nYou can set up any number of unique format types to accommodate different\ntypes of work in which you may be involved (i.e., different settings for different firms\nwith whom you work or for federal, state or other court requirements, CART, or other\ntypes of applications). You can save time by saving each group of settings in a user\nsettings file. This file contains information about job file locations, hardware (e.g.,\nyour writer) descriptions, translation rules, paragraph formats, document appearance,\nediting preferences (including customized prefixes and suffixes), and much more.\nBefore you start a new job in Eclipse, you can select which of the user settings files to\nuse, and save yourself the time of creating all those individual formats and\nrequirements for each job. (You might want to think of the settings file as being\nsomething like a template that you can apply to different files.)\nUsers and User Settings 111\nUser.ini Consolidation Naming Option\nEclipse 11 introduces the ability to organize your ini files into groups, based on\nsimple and familiar naming conventions.\nYou will need one user.ini file with the âorganizationâ name you want to use.\nOther user.ini files can use the âorganizationâ name followed by an underscore ( _ )\nand a unique designator for that specific ini.\nThe load settings window showing consolidated users and the corresponding users in Windows.\nVISUALIZERS:\n112 Eclipse Help\nB1_Load_Settings.mp4\nC5 - Save Settings vs. Create New User Format\nB1a - How to Undo Changes to User Settings (if not yet saved)\nC6 - How to Delete a User Format\nJ3a - SET files\n7.3.1 Moving settings from one user to another\nMoving settings from one user to another\nYou can use the User settings/User tab/Export settings.. button to\ncreate files that contain portions of your user settings.\nYou can use these files to exchange selected settings with other Eclipse\nusers without disrupting other settings.\nFor example, a firm could distribute its standard paragraph and\ndocument format settings among its reporters, without changing the number\nconversion and translation settings that vary from one reporter to another.\nFor details on Exporting and Importing settings, and what is exported\nto the .set file, see User Tab: Importing and Exporting settings 102\nDisplay settings and User Interface 113\n8 Display settings and User Interface\nSetting the Display the Way You Want\nYou can change the way Eclipse displays program and workspace\nfeatures.\nÂ· Get Maximum screen space\nÂ· Got to the Window menu /View submenu to toggle on or off the\nStatus bar , Info bar, Document tab bar, Paragraph bar, Ruler bar,\nNote bar, Realtime status, Closed captioning preview, Connections,\nSeating Chart, and Script list.\nÂ· You can also use View Toggles on the Display tab of User\nsettings to turn on or off these features.\nYou can also gain screen space by:\nÂ· Arranging your document windows\nÂ· Customizing your toolbars\nÂ· Adjusting the way text displays, including margins, line numbers and\nwhite space. Note: icons and buttons auto-scale to the size indicated\nby your windows scaling, including the graphics shown on dialogs.\n8.1 Get MaximumScreen Space\nGet Maximum Screen\nSpace\nWhen youâre editing a transcript, youâll want to be able to see as much\nof the text as possible on the screen. (Screen area, in fact, is so valuable to\nmost computer users that itâs often called âreal estate.â)\nOne way to increase your usable real estate, without changing font\nsizes and margin displays, is to use Full screen mode, F11 (or Window\nmenu/Full screen.) F11 is a toggle that will turn Full screen on and off.\nThis will let the Eclipse program, toolbars, and document window fill your\nscreen space, and will remove the status, paragraph, and scroll bars from\nview.\n113\n1084\n1058\n116 122\n951\n114 Eclipse Help\nTurning features on and off to make the screen more\nreadable\nWindow menu/View submenu\nFor added\nscreen space, you\ncan go to the\nWindow menu/View\nsubmenu and turn\noff the Status bar,\nthe Paragraph bar,\nthe Info bar, the\nRuler, and other\nfeatures.\n(Note that\nView menu items\nwork as toggles).\nYou can also\nturn off the notes\nwindow if you donât\nneed to see them\nand want the added\nspace. If notes are\ndisplayed, go to the\nWindow\nmenu/View, and\nselect the view\nNotebar item.\nIf you turn off\nthe notebar, the\ndisplay will get\nlarger to fit the\nwindow. When you\nturn it back on, the\ndisplay will shrink\nback down again.\nThe Auto-zoom\nfeature in the\nNotebar options on\nthe Display tab has\nan impact on what\nwill happen if the notebar is turned off. If Auto-zoom has been checked, the\nsame amount of text will be displayed, but the font will be larger. If Autozoom\nhas not been checked, more text will be visible and the font will remain\nthe same size.\nThe Notebar on or off state is recorded separately for realtime and nonrealtime\nsessions. In other words, if you turn it off during a realtime session,\nthe next realtime session will open with the Notebar off. A document being\nedited not in realtime will record whether the Notebar should be on or off\nwhile editing normally.\nDisplay settings and User Interface 115\nThe \"Zoom\" factor, resolution, and font size\nIt is important to note that the size of the transcript window and of\nyour monitor, the âzoomâ factor you are using, and your monitorâs resolution\naffect how much of a document page you can see. Standard monitors cannot\ndisplay an entire 8.5â by 11â page at actual size. To see an entire page, use\nthe zoom-out feature. Default settings for the screen resolution you want are\ndetermined in Windows under Start/Settings/Control Panel/Appearance\nand Themes (or Display/Settings). The higher the resolution the more of\nyour page youâll see but it will also be smaller. Ordinarily, youâll want to\nselect the highest resolution possible. If you go into the Windows display\nsettings and go to Settings/Advanced and change the font size to scale\nyour display, the fonts get large on all Windows programs, and the dialog box\ncontrols all expand to fit the new text. Eclipse takes the screen scaling in\nWindows into account in all phases of the program, so if you have a laptop\nwith a 1600 X 1200 resolution screen, you can boost the resolution all the\nway up and set the font size to 150% or even 200% and Eclipse will be\nreadableâeven the menus and dialog controls.\nNote that if you lower the resolution while running Eclipse with windows\nlike the Realtime status window open, the windows may go off the screen. If\nyou change the screen resolution and then run the program, the windows will\nreposition onscreen, but if you change resolution while the program is\nrunning, the windows will not come back until the program is restarted or\nanother user is loaded.\n8.2 Connection Status Indicators\nConnection Status Indicators\nAt the top-right of the screen, on the menu bar, a series of lights\nappears with three-letter codes. A green light indicates that the connection is\nworking. A red light indicates that the connection is not working. Some lights\nwill turn red simply because you're not using them.\nGive how many different connections there are to websites, Internet\nservices, Com ports, USB devices, bluetooth, modems, etc., that are outside\nof Eclipse's control, this is a helpful quick reference to let you know when\nthings are working or not.\nNote that everyone will see a different set of lights depending on the\nservices that are relevant for them. For example, only a captioner attempting\nto use a modem will even see a modem light. But once it appears, a red light\nlets you know when the connection is off.\nHere is a complete list of all of the lights that can appear depending on\nyour settings:\n116 Eclipse Help\nSrv â the universal Connection Magic server used for Team Editing,\nBridge Mobile, keyless licenses, and usage tracking.

In many case âType\ntextâ is one of the numbered choices\nin AutoMagic, so you would just type,\nfor example, 3 followed by the\nnumber you need to add to the\ntranscript.\nTurning off the Use numbers\noption disables the use of numbers to\nactivate commands, although they\nremain visible in the Info bar. It is\nrecommended that you leave the Use\nnumbers option on.\nIf you turn Use numbers off,\nyou will be able to select most\noptions using their hotkeys, but you will only be able to select an option that\nis NOT a command (such as Convert in the Info bar that appears when you\nopen Eclipse) by clicking it, or by using the AutoMagic hotkeys, Alt+1, Alt+2\nâ¦ Alt+0.\nThe 10 AutoMagic hotkeys are all available in new installations, but if\nyou have an existing .ini file, and want to use them, you will have to go to\nUser settings/Edit tab/Keyboard, and modify the keystrokes.\nIf you use hyperkeys, you can set up the number keys as AutoMagic\nhotkeys. You would then use Type text (N) when you need to type in a\nnumber.\nHotkeys - you can turn off the AutoMagic hotkeys to save space. This\noption is good for experienced users who already know all the hotkeys and\njust like the time-saving suggestions.\nCheck Pop-up if you want a Pop-up box with the Info bar choices\nappearing in your document area.

This is useful when you are adjusting margins or text box, as it allows you to\nsee the effects of your changes on-screen; however, it will override any display\ncustomizations you may have made.\nThere is no way to \"turn off\" WYSIWYG. WYSIWYG refers to a certain\narrangement of all items on the Display tab, rather than to something that can be\nturned on or off.\nThe Editing Font button allows to select a font for the display of text files .\nThis will allow you to view a document in a font other than the one in which you will\nprint.\n434\n131\n694\n124 Eclipse Help\nSelect the desired font from the font dialog . Note: you may only select the\nfont type, and attributes (bold/italic/underline). Changing the font size will have no\neffect. If you want to make the type bigger or smaller, use the Zoom controls.\nIf you select a proportional font instead of a fixed font, it will affect how things\nline up and will make it difficult to line up text on administrative pages, headers,\nfooters, etc. Also, if you have the ruler turned on, the text in a proportional font may\nnot extend to the ruler marking indicated by the right margin setting for that\nparagraph. For example, if the right margin is set at 52, a line of text that is all i's will\nonly extend to about 24 on the ruler. A line of text that is all W's will extend past the\nedge of the page to about 56 on the ruler. With a Fixed font, both lines will extend to\n52 on the ruler. Hint: An easy way to find the fixed fonts that are available on your\ncomputer is to go to Notebar options on the Display tab and click the Font button.\nOnly fixed fonts will be listed in that section.\nTo remove an editing font, click the Editing Font button, and then click Escape.\nThe display font will be set to the font that is used for printing.\nThe UI Font button will change the font that is used in Eclipse dialogs.

When a reporter\ntypes text, it appears in \"typed\" color (\"Text typed in by\nthe user\"). When a scopist types text, it appears in\n\"scoped\" color (\"Scopist text added on the edit\nstation\"). But if you are using multiple scopists and\nproofreaders, particularly with the live team editing\nfeature, just those two text types are not enough. You\ncan set up any of the 8 user-defined types for these\nadditional scopists and proofreaders. During team\nediting, the team editing user names in the connection\ndialog will now appear in the user color.\nYou can manually change any text in a document\nto one of these types by block marking the text and\nusing Format/text type (Ctrl+Shift+R) and choose one\nof the user 1 - user 8 options.\nYou can specify that all typed in text by the current user should appear in one of\nthese types by going into User settings/Edit and checking on the Edit station user\ncheckbox. That option is followed by a number which can go from 0 to 8. Setting this\nto 0 will use the scopist text type, but 1 - 8 will use the user 1 - user 8 type.\nNote that even if the Edit station user checkbox is off, the text type selected\nhere will be used to indicate the proofreading marks created in any of the e-book\nproofreading, Bridge Mobile proofreading, or PDF proofreading features.\nYou can scan to any combination of these text types using Move/Scan/Any\nand checking on the eligible text types that you wish to scan for.\nTeam Editing status colors are listed last in the color selections list.\nText types for Paragraph labels\nEclipse records a text type for each paragraph label, which allows it to behave\nexactly like a text type for the body text of the paragraph.\nInserting any type of paragraph manually using functions such as F3 for\nQuestions, F4 for Answers or F2 for speakers will cause that paragraph label to appear\nin the appropriate typed-in-text color (typed for reporters, scopist color for the edit\nstation, or user 1 - user 8 if selected.)\nFor more on Paragraph label text types, see Paragraph labels .\nOther Items\nThe following items pertain to the appearance of margins, line numbers, and\nwhite space:\nLeft Margin: Uncheck this to remove the left margin from the display. The line\nnumbers will appear flush left. This eliminates unused space from the display, and\nlets you see more of the transcript horizontally. If the Left Margin checkbox is marked,\nwhite space corresponding to the width of the documentâs left margin will be\ndisplayed.\n462\nDisplay settings and User Interface 129\nLine Numbers: If unchecked, line numbers will be invisible. If checked, the line\nnumbers will be displayed.\nSpacing: If unchecked, the vertical spacing between lines will be removed --\nthe text will display as single-spaced. This allows you to fit more lines onto the\ndisplay. To display text with line spacing relevant to the paragraph formats (as set in\nUser Settings/Paragraph formats), mark the checkbox.\nPrint Commands: If checked, the print command itself will be visible. If\nunchecked, the command will not be visible, but you will see its effects. Lockspaces\nwill display as tildes ( ~ ) when print commands are displayed. For more information,\nsee the Print Commands page.\nAll Caps: If checked, the display will appear in ALL CAPS.\nSmooth Scrolling: If checked, new lines will scroll onto the screen slowly,\ninstead of all at once. This option is mostly for CART users, or other applications\nwhere others are viewing your Eclipse display.\nFont Width allows you to resize the font horizontally. A setting of 0 will use the\ndefault font width; any other number will skew the font.\nCursor Size and Hyperkey size control the Width(W) and Height(H) size of the\ncursor when hyperkeys are off and when they are on, respectively. It is recommended\nthat you set these to different values, so you can determine whether or not hyperkeys\nare on by simply looking at the cursor.\nThe default settings are 36 for Cursor Width (the thin cursor) and 144 for\nHyperkey Width (the wide cursor). If you set the height to zero, cursor height will be\nautomatically optimized to suit the size of the text.\nIf you want the cursor to be invisible (such as for CART), set the height AND\nwidth to 0 (zero).\nYou can use these settings to create a horizontal cursor instead of a vertical one\nby setting the height very small and the width as large as a single character (usually\n150.)\nTo set the cursor size, go to the display properties by either the User\nsettings/Display (if you want the change to become a part of your settings) or the\nDisplay toolbar button (if you want the option to change only the current editing\nsessions). To set the Width (W) or Height (H), enter a number in the Cursor size W:\nor H: fields, or the Hyperkey size W: or H: fields. A value of 10 creates a thin cursor.\nFor a medium-width cursor, enter 100. Because the cursor width is relative to the\ndisplay size of text, the cursor width changes as you zoom in and out of a document.\nPage Boundaries determine how much space is visible between pages. A\nsetting of Full will show all vertical space at the bottom and top of each page.\nCompact will eliminate this white space from the display, and show only a thick black\nline between pages. None will eliminate all sp ce between pages; Line 25 will appear\nright after Line 1.\n362\n130 Eclipse Help\nNotebar Options opens the Notebar Options Dialog , where you can change\nthe appearance of the steno bar that appears in text files. The Notebar options\ndialog window can also be opened by right-clicking anywhere in the Notebar. See\nNotebar Options help page for details.\nLines Below Cursor controls the number of lines of text that appear beneath\nthe cursor when you scroll down in the document. For example, if this is set to 5,\nwhen you press and hold the down-arrow key, the cursor holds a position five lines\nabove the bottom line of visible text. This allows you to determine where the cursor\nappears vertically, so you can keep your eyes focused on one row while editing. There\nis no upper limit to the value you can set this, but it will stop the cursor at the top of\nthe screen as an upper limit.\nPage boundaries\nYou can control how distinctly the boundaries between pages are displayed. For\nexample, if you are still editing the transcript you might not care where the page\nboundaries are, so you would want to minimize the space they take on the screen.\nHowever, if you are getting ready to print you might want to see where the\nboundaries are, thus emphasize them on the screen. In Eclipse you have three\noptions for displaying the page boundaries: none, compact, full.\nTo set the page boundaries, use the Display tab button, (or use the Display\ntoolbar button); page boundaries options are in the bottom right corner of the\nwindow. For true âWhat You See Is What You Getâ display, the Full option must be\nselected. This option creates a noticeable space between pages and allows Eclipse to\ndisplay graphical text boxes on a page. The Compact option shows page breaks as a\nnarrow line. The None option does not show page breaksâthe only way to determine\nwhere page breaks occur is by viewing line numbers.\n131\n131\nDisplay settings and User Interface 131\nPage numbers are displayed when the page boundaries are set to Full or\nCompact. When using no page boundaries, the page numbers could be in the way of\nthe text, and are not displayed.\nWYSIWYG\nTo see how the document will look when printed, use WYSIWYG (What You See\nIs What You Get, pronounced âwizzywigâ) mode. Click the WYSIWYG button on the\nDisplay tab (or Display toolbar button). This button automatically selects those\ndisplay options necessary for WYSIWYG mode. Deselecting those options will take you\nout of WYSIWYG mode.\nVISUALIZERS:\nA5 - Colors\nA3 - WYSIWYG\nA3a - Print Commands\nA4 - Notebar\nA4a - Notebar Options\nA4a - Notebar Options 2\nE3a-Auto-Brief Display\nM3 - Auto-Magic Display\n8.4.1 Notebar Options\nNotebar Options\nRELATES TO: Display tab of User Settings ,\nText Files , Dictionary display .\nThis dialog allows you to change the look of the notebar that appears on the\nright-hand side of text files and dictionaries .

If unchecked, you will see raw steno.\nIf Dictionary Entries is checked, the bottom of the notebar will show you which\ndictionary the current entry is in, and how it is defined. Each dictionary has a oneletter\ncode: M for Main, J for Job, and 1 through 9 for User 1 through User 9. If the\nentry is in more than one dictionary, all will appear.\nIf you turn this on, any time the cursor is on any dictionary entry the steno\nwindow will draw a divider at the bottom with enough room to show the dictionary\nentries. Each entry will be preceded by a single letter indicating which dictionary it's\nin, i.e. (M)ain, (J)ob, or 1 through 9.\nIf a particular piece of steno exists in multiple dictionaries, you will see each of\nthem listed on a separate line, much like the Review dictionaries function in the\nglobaling window.\nFor example, if you have TOPL = Tom in your main dictionary and TOPL = Thom\nin your user 3 dictionary, when you place your cursor on TOPL the steno window will\nshow this at the bottom:\nM:Tom\n858\nDisplay settings and User Interface 133\n----3:Thom\nIf the entry you're on is a slop stroke, it will show you the slop stroke itself,\nfollowed by the text for the entry that the slop stroke points to.\nIf the entry contains a comment, the comment text will appear on a line below\nthat.\nIf the entry is a conflict, the conflict choices will fan out on separate lines with\nthe appropriate numbers by them, making it much easier to read what the choices\nare, particularly for long conflicts. The graphic above shows a conflict in the user 1\ndictionary.\nIf you want to see the dictionary that contains a particular entry, hit F9,\nAlt+Letter, [enter], (using whatever letter appears to the left of the entry in the\nsteno window).\nOr you can click on the dictionary entry and Eclipse will open the dictionary\ncontaining that entry and jump directly to the entry. Clicking on M:yes will open your\nMain dictionary, and jump to the entry for \"yes.\"\nIf you have the Phonetic strokes turned on, the strokes in the dictionary info\nbar will also appear phonetically.\nIn addition, if you have Auto-brief turned on, Eclipse will show you any\nalternative steno strokes that you could use to write that entry in fewer strokes,\nreminding you of briefs that you could use in the future.\nSteno Width allows you to determine the width of the steno window. The\ndefault is the maximum of 22 characters, because that's how many keys are in the\nstandard steno machine keyboard. You can set this number lower to make the notebar\nnarrower and eliminate empty space. However, this can cause some steno outlines to\nbe truncated in the display.\nClick the Font button to chose a different font for the notebar. Only proportional\nfonts (fonts where all characters are the same width) may be used. You may,\nhowever, select a different font size; this will effectively resize the notebar. (The\nnotebar's physical size is determined by the number of characters you selected under\nSteno Width, and the width of each character as determined by the font size.)\nThe Font sample box shows you what your selected font looks like.\nYou may also view timecodes in the notebar. Select either Relative or\nAbsolute, and each steno stroke in the notebar will appear next to its timecode.\nNone will remove timecodes from the notebar display.\nIf Auto-Zoom is checked, opening and closing the steno window will\nautomatically zoom the text, to use all available space.\nIf you do not wish to view the notebar at all, it can be turned off via the\nWindow/View menu .\nVISUALIZERS:\nA4 - Notebar\nA4a - Notebar Options\nA4a - Notebar Options 2\n1086\n134 Eclipse Help\n9 Dictionaries\nDictionaries\nTo translate your steno notes, Eclipse uses a dictionary that defines\nstrokes. Each user setup in Eclipse has a main dictionary that is by default\nused for translation. In addition to the main dictionary, you can have a\ndictionary for each job as well as other specialized dictionaries. For\nexample, if you work often with medical and engineering cases, you might\nhave a dictionary for medical terms and another for engineering. These\ndictionaries can be added to a translation along with a main dictionary to\ntranslate a note file.\nDictionary files have their own format and a .dix file extension. You can\nlook at your dictionary and see the steno stroke and its corresponding\ntranslations and also edit the dictionary. A translation for any given outline\ncould be a single word, a phrase, a Eclipse editing command, prefix or suffix,\nconflict, or other formatting code.\nYou can import dictionaries from other CAT systems, build dictionaries\nfrom scratch, or extract a set of entries from one dictionary into another.\nDictionary maintenance is critical. You should make one (or more)\ncopies, backups, of your dictionaries on a regular basis.\n9.1 Dictionaries\nDictionaries\nRELATES TO: Dictionaries dialog , Open\nDictionary , Working With Dictionaries .\nA dictionary is a list of steno outlines and their equivalent definitions.\nDictionaries may also contain text globals .\nWhen you translate a job or do realtime , the steno translates against your\nmain dictionary, and one or more additional dictionaries.\nTo enter a dictionary, press F9 and then select the dictionary you want to work\nwith.

If you open an old document, this feature may only\nshow the main dictionary.\nDictionaries 137\nIf you pick a job dictionary from this list, it will check the same folder as the text\nfile (the .ecl file) and if it doesn't find the dictionary there it will then try the jobs\nfolder as defined in User settings/User/Advanced... If the job dictionary does not\nphysically exist and you select it to open, Eclipse will create one on the fly but it will\nbe blank. The same thing will happen if you global into a dictionary that doesn't exist\n(Eclipse will create the dictionary and add the entry).\nIf you wish to open a dictionary that is not on the list, use the Browse button to\ndisplay the open file dialog.\nIf you hit the Open all button, it will open ALL the dictionaries. Once all of the\ndictionaries are open, you can work in the job and all of the dictionaries will track your\ncursor.\nThere are also Add and Remove buttons to allow you to add or remove items\nfrom this list. You can also reorder the dictionaries by selecting one and using the\nMove up or Move down buttons to move it or use Ctrl+up or Ctrl+down.\nIf you are currently in a translation and you Add, Remove or change the order\nof the dictionaries in this list, it will change how the dictionaries are being used in the\ncurrent translation.\n9.3 Viewing and Editing dictionary files\nViewing and Editing dictionary files\nEclipse dictionaries, like other Eclipse files, can be displayed within the main\nprogram window.\nWhen a dictionary is the active document in Eclipse, the dictionary name also\nappears in the title bar of the main program window, after the userâs name. In the\nexample, the user is Helen Wilson and the dictionary is TranJob1.\nWhen you look at a dictionary, youâll see the individual entries, one entry per\nline (an entry can consist of more than one word or steno stroke), with detailed\ninformation available in columns.\n138 Eclipse Help\nIf any information in any of the columns exceeds the width of the column, the\ntext will trail off with â...â at the end of it, indicating that there's not enough room to\nshow the entire contents.\nThe date/time columns (Created, Modified, Used) will be blank if the software\nis unable to determine when an event occurred, or if it has never occurred. For\nexample, if an entry was created but has never been modified, the modified field will\nbe blank for that entry. Likewise, if it has never been used in a translation, the used\nfield will be blank.\nYou can resize any of the columns by clicking and dragging the border between\nthe labels at the top of the display. You can reduce a column's size all the way to zero\nif you wish.\nYou can change the order of the columns to display the information in any order\nyou like by clicking and dragging the column header left or right.

If you wish to reverse the sort\norder, click on the same column header again. An arrow will indicate which column is\ncurrently being used to sort the entries and which direction it is being sorted. In the\nexample below, the entries are sorted by Text, in descending order. If you prefer to\nsort your dictionaries by text, or by date the entry was created, etc., that preference\nis remembered permanently for the next time you open a dictionary.\nDictionaries 139\nWhen your dictionary is sorted by text, as you move through a document, it will\ntrack to the text of the main dictionary entry for that steno, showing you all of the\nways that you write that entry. If you have a different dictionary open, it will show\nyou the ways that same word can be written in the other dictionary. That can be a\nhelpful tool if you're working on alternate ways of writing things and you have a\nresource such as a standard dictionary from another writing theory or a copy of a\nfriend's dictionary.

Number of words in this entry.\nYou can sort the dictionary by any of these categories by clicking the gray column\nheader for the criteria you wish to sort on. Click it a second time to sort in the\nopposite order. For example, clicking the Text header will sort the entries from A to\nZ; clicking it a second time will reorder them from Z to A.\nOn the right-hand side of the dictionary file window is a vertical box containing\ninformation for this entry. To turn this box on and off, use the View Notebar item\non the Window/View menu.\nCustomizing The Display\nYou may click-and-drag the dividers between columns to change the width of a\ncolumn. To do this, put the mouse pointer on the divider. If you are in the right place,\nthe pointer will look like this: . Click-and-drag to resize the columns.\nAlternatively, you may set a column width by selecting Display Properties\nfrom the Window menu , or by right-clicking a dictionary and selecting Display.\nEither way, the Dictionary Display dialog will appear:\nSelect the column you wish to change from the Column list, and enter the\ndesired width into the Width box. You may make a column invisible by setting Width\nto 0, or by clicking Hide.\n1086\n1088\n1084\nDictionaries 143\nYou can change the order of the columns by selecting a column from the list, and\nclicking Move Up or Move Down.\nYou can also change the apperance of the date/time that appears in the Created,\nModified, and Used columns. To do this, click Date/Time Format, and select the\ndesired format from the Insert Time/Date dialog .\nIf you want this information to be conveyed in terms of \"number of days ago\"\ninstead of a concrete date, which takes up much less space, click Date Offset. After\nchanging or clicking Date offset, a preview of the date text you will see will appear\nbelow the Date/Time Format and Date Offset buttons.\nThe Sort list will sort the column you have chosen, just as if you had clicked the\ncolumn header. To use the Sort setting, select the column you wish to sort by, then\nselect Forward or Backward in the sort selector, and hit OK.\nIf Number Entries is checked, each dictionary entry will be numbered on the left\nside.\nIf Sync With Editing is checked, and you have a dictionary and a text file\nopen simultaneously, the cursor in the dictionary will jump to the entry that the\ncursor is on in the text file.

The column\nchanges on the fly as you modify the\nnumber to show you what the result\nwill be. You may find this easier than\nclicking and dragging, particularly if\nyou have resized a column down to\nzero, making it tricky to get back\nwithout this feature.\nYou can use the Move up and\nMove down buttons to change the\norder of the columns without using the\nmouse.\nThe Hide button will hide a column, by changing the column width to\nzero.\nThe Sync with editing checkbox indicates whether dictionaries are\nsynchronized with other documents. If this is turned on, as you move in any\ndocument, the currently open dictionaries jump to the same entry as the\ncursor. If you turn it off, dictionaries will stay where they were.\nTo use the Sort setting, select the column you wish to sort by, then\nselect Forward or Backward in the sort selector, and hit OK.\nThe Number entries checkbox determines whether or not the entries\nare numbered on the left side. You can also set the date/time format used by\nthe date/time columns.\nAlternately, if you want to have the information about how old entries\nare in a way that takes up much, much less space, simply press the Date\noffset button instead, and the columns will show you how old all of the\nentries are in days.\nThe âsteno windowâ option in the dictionary display can be turned on or\noff using the Window/View Toggles/Note bar (steno) menu (or\nCtrl+Shift+3). This window shows complete details of the currently selected\nentry, including steno in paper format, the text, all of the dates, etc., no\nmatter which columns are displayed.\nOne of the advantages of this window is that if you have a long piece of\ntext, steno, or a comment, it will wrap to multiple lines so that you can see\nall of it, even if it's truncated in the column display. The font size and the\nsteno size affect the width of the dictionary steno window.\n372\nDictionaries 147\nThe Notebar button opens the Notebar options dialog, where you can\nadjust the characteristics of the dictionary steno window.\nIf you have User settings/Display/Notebar options/Phonetic\nstrokes turned on, it will affect the dictionary steno display as well as the\ndisplay in the documents.\n9.3.3 Editing your dictionary\nEditing your dictionary\nYou may wish to edit your dictionary to trim unused entries, or those\nolder than a certain date, or after sorting by any of the available parameters\n(columns).\nAlways create a backup of your dictionary before performing\nmajor changes.\nYou can sort, mark, and move or delete dictionary entries in a great\nvariety of ways. For example, if you sort by Date Used, you can mark and\ndelete all the entries you haven't used in a period of time. You can sort by AI,\nor Find the \\ character in the text to see and edit all your conflicts.\nNote: This feature replaces the âOptimizeâ function found in previous\nversions.\n9.3.4 Moving around in a dictionary\nMoving around in a dictionary\nIf you are in a dictionary and you press a letter, you will jump to the\nfirst entry that uses that letter's steno equivalent.\nIt prefers left-side phonetics, so when you hit âLâ you will get the\nentries starting with HR, not the entries starting with the right-side -L key.\nThere are a relatively small number of right-side-only entries in a\ndictionary, and they all appear at the top, so it makes sense to skip those.\nIf you have sorted the dictionary by text, you will jump to the first\nentry that starts with that text. It is case-sensitive, and you can type\nmultiple letters to jump to the first entries that start with those letters as a\nsequence. After a one-second pause, any new letter hit will be considered the\nstart of a new word.\nNote that this will not work if you have hyperkeys turned on.\nMoving around using steno strokes\n148 Eclipse Help\nYou can type the first several letters of a steno stroke in order to jump\ndirectly to the dictionary entry you're interested in without having to use the\nsearch or go to functions.\nThis feature does allow phonetic equivalents. As long as you type the\nletters with less than a second delay, it will assume that you intend them as\na sequence. For example, if you hit \"N\" it might jump to \"TPH- = in\", then\nhitting \"I\" will jump to \"TPHEU = any\", then hitting \"N\" again will jump to\n\"TPHEUPB = anyone\".\nNote that this will not work if you have hyperkeys turned on.\nMarkers\nThe Move menu/Advanced/Markers function works in dictionaries,\nallowing you to create bookmarks that you can jump to later.\nThese are temporary and will not be remembered once the dictionary\nis closed.

With a dictionary window\nactive, you can add entries using several methods:\nÂ· Use the Tools menu/Build Dictionary command to generate a\ndictionary from scratch, based on outlines you enter for a standard set\nof entries. Your input writer realtime settings should be configured\n(see âEntering Stroke in Realtimeâ) before using the Build dictionary\ncommand, so you can use your writer to create the entries.\nÂ· Use the File menu/Import command to convert and insert entries\nfrom another dictionary file format (such as RTF-CRE). When using\nFile/Import from within a dictionary, you can select multiple files to\nimport.\nÂ· Indirect methods for placing entries in the dictionary include globals,\nthe Block/write and Block/separate commands, and pasting\nentries that have been copied or cut from other Eclipse dictionaries.\n945\n150 Eclipse Help\nYou do not have to have a dictionary active to add entries with these\nindirect methods.\nÂ· You can also use the Edit menu/Add dictionary entry command\n(shortcut: Ctrl+D) to add new entries one at a time.\n9.4.1 Creating a New Dictionary File Using Open Dictionary command (F9)\nCreating a New Dictionary File Using Open Dictionary\ncommand (F9)\nTo create a new dictionary, select File/Open dictionary (or F9) and\nthe Open File dialog window appears. Type a name for the new dictionary in\nthe Name field. You do not have to type the â.dixâ extension; it will be added\nautomatically.\nBy default it will go to the folder you specified for your job files.\nAlthough you can store your dictionaries anywhere on your computer, itâs\nusually a good idea to store them in your jobs folder. If necessary, use the\ncontrols in the file dialog window to select an alternate folder in which to\nstore the dictionary.\nClick OK.\nAn alert box will appear, stating the file does not exist and asking\nwhether you want to create the file. Click Yes.\nDictionaries 151\nThe dictionary file is then created and opened within your Eclipse main\nprogram window. The title bar of the dictionary window shows the filename\nyou gave it.\n9.4.2 Build Dictionary\nBuild Dictionary\nRELATES TO: Working With Dictionaries 672 .\n152 Eclipse Help\nThe Build Dictionary feature allows you to construct a starting dictionary by\nusing either a realtime connection, or the steno emulator .\nIf youâre new to reporting you might have to build your dictionary from scratch.\nEclipse helps you do that by providing a standard word list to which you assign your\nstroke outlines. You can enter the strokes either by using a writer set for realtime or\nby using your keyboard and mouse to select outlines in the steno writer emulator.\nTo build a starter dictionary:\n1. If you are going to build the dictionary via a realtime connection to your\nwriter, first you must set up the realtime connection. Go to User Settings\n(Alt+U)/Inp ut tab. Check that the correct writer is selected. Use the Setup\nbutton to check that the COM port or other input settings are correct. More\ndetails on setting up your writer are in the Working With Realtime page.\n2. Select Build Dictionary from the Tools menu. The Build dictionary dialog\nopens.\n3. The first entry will appear. When the first entry appears, you will note it is in\nthe upper left corner of the dialog, in a text box labeled Word:, and a list of\nsuggested strokes appears in a numbered list below it. Eclipse's word list\nbegins with formatting entries (e.g. {A} for an answer paragraph), then has\nsingle word entries, and ends with common phrases.\n483 893\n226\n483\nDictionaries 153\no If you are using a steno machine, enter the stroke or strokes you wish to\nuse for this entry, and then hit your Automark stroke to accept it. If you\nmake a mistake, press your Division stroke to clear the steno for this\nentry.\no If you are using your computer keyboard, press the number key for the\ndesired steno outline. If you want a stroke that is not one of the 4 offered,\npress 5 to open the steno emulator .\n4. You will be moved to the next item in the list. Repeat step 4 to enter the\nsteno for that item; you may continue until the list is finished, or you may\nclick Cancel to stop the dictionary build.\nIf you want to make a change to the word that is suggested, such as changing a\nword that is capitalized to all lower-case, you can edit it in the word box, and the\nedited word will be added to the dictionary when you select the steno.\nWithin the Word: text box, you can use Ctrl+K in order to cycle through\ncapitalizations, as well as other extended keystrokes, like Ctrl+W to insert a special\ncharacter.\nThere are steno definition buttons immediately below the OK, Back, Next and\nCancel buttons. These buttons display the steno strokes you can use to navigate in\nthe dictionary build process.\nThe default steno strokes are -RBGS, STPH, -FPLT, and *. You can press any of\nthese buttons to re-define the steno.\nThe functions are:\nOk: accept the current entry Cancel: start over the steno for this entry\nNext: skip the current entry Prev: go back to the previous entry\nYou do not have to build the dictionary in one sitting. If you cancel a dictionary\nbuild partway through, following the above steps will pick up where you left off.\nConflicts - If the same steno stroke(s) are used for multiple word list items,\nEclipse automatically creates conflicts.\nDouble strokes â To create a double-stroke entry in the steno emulator, hit one\nstroke, then hit Alt+C or the Copy button to duplicate it.\nAdditional entries for the same word - If you set up a âstitch modeâ stroke,\nyou can use that stroke during dictionary building instead of hitting the âbackâ button\nto return to the previous entry. This allows you to enter additional steno for the same\nword, if you wish to have several ways of writing it.\nTo build a dictionary using a word list:\nYou can also create or add to your Main dictionary, or a Job dictionary using a\nword list. You can either use the list that comes with Eclipse, which includes several\nthousand common words, and suffixes and prefixes, or you can prepare a word list,\nconsisting of an ascii file with one word or phrase per line.\n893\n164\n154 Eclipse Help\nIf you have built a list using Analyze documents , and Eclipse sees it in your\nJobs folder, it will assume you want to use it, and will automatically choose it instead\nof the Build.txt default wordlist.\nThe Additional word lists available button takes you to the \"Dictionary\nJumpstart\" website where you can find additional resources for building your\ndictionary.\nThe Build dictionary dialog contains a Browse button that allows you to pick\nthe text file you have set up as your word list. You can then build a dictionary using\nthe words in that text file.\n(Note that building from a text file does not remember the file you were in or\nthe position. It's intended for quick vocabulary preparation from short word lists such\nas case-specific or show-specific words.)\nSee the section on \"Customizing\" for details on setting up your word list.\nRemember that you can use an associate's job dictionary and create a word list\nfrom it by opening the dictionary and using File/Export.\nCustomizing\nYou can customize the list of items you are offered in the Build Dictionary dialog\nby editing the BUILD.TXT file in the Eclipse folder, or by creating your own wordlist.txt\nfile. Each entry in the list follows this syntax:\ntext|steno suggestion 1 |steno suggestion 2 |steno suggestion 3|steno\nsuggestion 4\nThe steno suggestions will be assigned to the 1, 2, 3, and 4 buttons on the Build\nDictionary dialog.\nNote that there is a space at the end of each steno suggestion:\nadvise|AD SRAOEUZ |SREUZ |SRAOEUZ |AD SREUS\nAlso, if you do not want to make all four suggestions, include all unused pipes at\nthe end of the entry:\nage|AEUPBLG |APBLG ||\nVISUALIZERS:\nH1 - Build Dictionary.mp4\nH1 - Analyze Documents\n155\n154\nDictionaries 155\n9.4.2.1 Analyze Documents\nAnalyze Documents\nTools/Analyze documents\nRELATES TO: Build\nDictionary\nThe Analyze Documents tool\nThe Analyze Documents tool reads and keeps track of every single word\nin all of the documents you select to analyze. It then goes through every\nentry in all of the selected dictionaries AND your main dictionary. It produces\ntwo reports and opens them. One is a .TXT file that will be opened in\nWindows Notepad or whatever your default .txt file editor is. The other is the\nANALYSIS.ECL file, an Eclipse job which contains a report of ALL of the\nconflicts between the selected dictionaries, including any conflict between\nthem or between one of them and your main dictionary.\nYou can use it to compare multiple dictionaries to find out where they\nuse the same steno, basically looking for conflicts between dictionaries; or\nyou can use it to analyze documents (transcripts, text files, or pdfs) to find\nwords or phrases you might need to add to your dictionary.\nIf you are a Voicewriter, see Voicewriting with Eclipse Vox:\nTools/Analyze Documents.\nThe Tools menu/Analyze documents command will open a dialog with\nseveral options:\n151\n1186\n156 Eclipse Help\nThe list of dictionaries can be populated using the \"Add\" button or select\nan item and hit \"Remove\" to remove it. You can select multiple dictionaries\nat once using Ctrl+click, Shift+click, etc.\nThe list of documents can be populated the same way. Note that\ndocuments can include Eclipse files, PDFs and ASCII files.\nAt the bottom of the dialog are the two reports that will be generated.\nYou can save them in any location and give them any name. By default, they\nwill be placed in your jobs folder and be named ANALYSIS.ECL and\nANALYSIS.TXT.\nHere's what this analysis tool does:\nIt reads and keeps track of every single word in all of the documents. It\nthen goes through every entry in all of the selected dictionaries AND your\nmain dictionary. It produces these two reports and immediately opens them.\nThe .TXT file will be opened in Windows Notepad or whatever your default\n.txt file editor is.\nDictionaries 157\nThe two reports it produces have the following information:\nThe ANALYSIS.TXT file is an ASCII word list that contains all of the\nwords from the selected documents that do NOT appear in any of the\ndictionaries that you selected. The words are listed according to the\nfrequency with which they appear, with the number of occurrences in\nbrackets. This gives you a way to build a list of specialized vocabulary words\nin preparation for doing a job if you have any sort of file from a previous\nreporter to work on the case. You could also gather vocabulary by\ncopying/pasting from websites into a text file and then running the analysis.\n158 Eclipse Help\nNote that the Tools/Build dictionary function allows you to select an\nASCII wordlist and build a dictionary by hitting strokes on the writer, so after\nreviewing the ANALYSIS.TXT file and saving it, you can easily use this word\nlist to perform the dictionary build function.\nThe analyze documents function disregards two categories of words that\nare likely simply variations of existing words: words ending in 's, and words\nin all caps that are already in the list in another case. This means that\nâGreene,â âGreene's,â and âGREENEâ are not treated as three different words.\nIn the ANALYSIS.TXT file, the suggested capital words are listed first,\nfollowed by the suggested lower-case words. Then there will be a short\nspace, followed by a list of capitalized phrases, then a list of lower-case\nphrases.\nThese phrases are collected based on the auto-brief rules, and\nrepresent phrases that you do not currently have dictionary entries for in the\ndictionaries that you selected for the analysis.\nNote that these phrases will often contain words that you do have\nentries for, so that you could write them as phrases. It is intended as a way\nto call your attention to phrases that happened multiple times in a document\nthat you might want to consider making a brief for ahead of time for a future\ntranslation.\nThe briefs included in the document analysis will include many\nadditional suggestions which could include items that you may want to add\nto your main dictionary, including common word phrases that you do not\nalready have dictionary entries for. (As of Version 10, this is no longer limited\nto phrases of capitalized words)\nIn order to make this, and the other analysis information, more useful,\nthe analysis report will include the usage score visible in the text, such as\n\"Consolidated Widgets [14]\" which tells you that this phrase appeared 14\ntimes in the document. The items are sorted by usage with the most\nfrequent ones first (after the supercategory of capitalized vs. uncapitalized\nwords.)\nIn order to make that information as useful as possible, note that it is\nNOT necessary to remove the bracketed frequency score if using this file\ndirectly in the \"build dictionary\" command. If you run \"build dictionary\" on a\ntext file and it contains a line like the above, it will only ask you for an entry\nfor \"Consolidated Widgets\" without the frequency text.\nThe ANALYSIS.ECL file is an Eclipse job which contains a report of ALL\nof the conflicts between the selected dictionaries, including any conflict\nbetween them or between one of them and your main dictionary.\nIf the same sequence of steno is used in any two dictionaries, it will add\na line to the ANALYSIS.ECL file showing you the steno, followed by the\nvarious ways in which that steno might translate depending on which\ndictionary you have selected.\nDictionaries 159\nMany of these may be expected and trivial, such as STPHAO =\n{S:SPEAKER01} | {S:MR. JONES}. However, when you see lines such as UPL\nPWAEUR TOE = Umberto | Humberto, you will want to adjust one of the\nentries. This can be particularly helpful if you have many dictionaries.\nThe second portion of the ANALYZE.ecl file is a report of all of the words\nand phrases (or other dictionary entry text items) that are separately defined\nin the different dictionaries, and the different steno that is used to write\nthem. The word will appear with each separate steno variation appearing on a\nseparate line. For example, if your main dictionary has three ways of writing\n\"plaintiff\" and your job dictionary has another, it will show you all four\nentries. This allows you to easily compare multiple different ways that you\nhave defined text.\nA note about how to best use the ANALYSIS.ECL file: Make sure that\nthe Steno window is visible and that you turn on the User\nsettings/Display/Notebar options/Dictionary entries checkbox. This\nwill show you exactly which dictionaries the currently highlighted entry\nappears in. You will note as you move through the ANALYSIS.ECL file that\nthere is steno tracking corresponding to the entries, and that the entry\ndisplay at the bottom shows which dictionaries the text comes from, such as\n\"M:Umberto,2:Humberto\". Remember that you can left-click directly on these\nlines in the steno window to open up the dictionary in question and jump\ndirectly to that entry.\n9.4.3 Adding individual entries\nAdding individual entries to a dictionary\nWhen a dictionary is open and active, you can add entries, one at a\ntime, with Add dictionary entry command (Ctrl+D). This command lets you\nmanually enter steno strokes and their translation(s).\nYou can also mark a block of text with F7 and use the add dictionary\nentry function to add an entry with the existing steno. You may make\nmodifications if you wish before pressing [enter] and it will also default to\nusing the marked text as the text for the new dictionary entry.\nTo add dictionary entries while you are editing or while you have a\ndictionary open and active:\n1. With a dictionary open or while editing a transcript, select the Edit\nmenu/Add dictionary entry command (Ctrl+D). The steno\nemulation windows appear on your screen.\n2. Enter the steno stroke. (See the Steno Emulator help page for\ndetails.)\n893\n160 Eclipse Help\n3. Click OK after completing the steno entry. A text definition window\nwill appear; the steno you just entered will appear in the title bar.\n(This window is very similar to what you use when globaling. If you\nare in a dictionary, it lacks the drop-down list of dictionaries which is\npresent if you global while editing a transcript.)\n4. Enter the definition in the top text-entry field. If the field has text in\nit, the stroke outline you entered already had a definition in the\ndictionary. You can delete, edit, or add to that definition.\n5. Select OK to complete the entry and add it to the dictionary.\nIn the text definition dialog, the field to the right of the Suggestions\nbox contains a drop down list of basic formatting codes for dictionary entries,\neach with a descriptive label. To add a code to the definition you are creating,\nselect it from the list. The formatting code is inserted at the cursorâs current\nposition in the definition field. For more information on how to write\ndefinitions, see Dictionary Syntax.\n9.5 Dictionary Syntax\nDictionary syntax\nGeneral Commands\nDictionary commands can be used during globaling and when you are\nadding or editing definitions. All command entries are enclosed in braces\n(also known as âcurly bracketsâ)â { and }. Entries NOT enclosed in braces\nare treated literally and will appear in text documents exactly as they are\nentered in the dictionary. Ordinal number suffixes (th, st, nd, rd) are an\nexception to this rule; they are preceded by the caret and are not within\nbracesâ^th, ^st, ^nd, ^rd.\nYou can also combine commands and text to create more complex\ndefinitions.\n958\nDictionaries 161\nDictionary entry Type Translation result\n{Q} command translated as a question paragraph\n(e.g. âQ.â)\nQ text Q\n{^ing} command suffix applied using suffix logic *\n^ing text ^ing\n{^}ing command\n+ text\nsuffix applied, but without suffix\nlogic (no automatic spelling\ncorrection).\n{Q}ok command\n+ text\nQ.

For example:\n50D = 50{}dollars~~ the double-braces allow the number conversion\nto process them separately. This entry will simply translate the 50{}dollars\n(as $50, most likely) and ignore the rest.\nIf you go into the text of a dictionary entry using the Text.. button in\nthe Entry properties, you can use the EntryText~~CommentText format to\ntype in a comment in lieu of typing the comment into the comment field. You\ncan use the ~~ as a shortcut to add comments to entries that you offer to\nother users or to remind yourself of what the entry is for, but it doesn't\nactually leave the ~~ in the text.

For these triggers to work, turn on automatic number conversion,\nby going to User settings, (Alt+U), Numbers tab, and selecting \"Number\nconversion.\"\n{#Q} Quantity\n{#M} MoneyÂ³\n{#G} Generic\n{#R} Roman numerals\n{#r} Lowercase Roman numerals (i)\n{#O} Ordinal\n{#P} Phone number (###) ###-####\n{#S} Social Security no. ###-##-####\n{#Z} Zip code #####-####\n{#T} Time ##:## or ##:##:##\n{#D} Date\nNote that this can handle 4-digit years (5272000 can result in 5/27/2000)\n(#DM) Date in month/day format (eg. 9/8)\n{#1}-{#9} User-defined formats\n{#W} Written out numbers\n{#N} Digits\nÂ³{#M?} Money type ({#MY}=Yen, for example)\nThese triggers can be written anywhere inside a number and apply only\nto a single number. Two exceptions are {#W} & {#N} which determine\nwhether or not a number is written out in digits, as they apply to a whole list\nof numbers. Eclipse determines what is part of a list by whether the numbers\nare separated by prepositions, conjunctions, or punctuation.\nDictionaries 163\nWhenever you use {#N} or {#W}, it remembers that as the write-out\nrule default for all of the numbers that follow until the translator sees one of\nthe following:\n1. Any non-noise word (User settings/Translate/non-capping words) or\nnon-conjunction.\n2. Any new paragraph/print command/autoinclude\n3. Any entry that capitalizes the next entry (terminal punctuation, etc.)\nAny of the above items cause the write-out rule to reset to the default\nbehavior of following the settings in the number conversion tab .\nNote: When you donât use a trigger, your lists may not come out\nconsistently. For example, if you've told it only to write out from 1-10 and if\nsomeone says âI have three kids. They're five, eight and 14.â that's exactly\nwhat you'll get. If you write {#N} before the five, however, they'll all come\nout in digits.\nNumbers in a list are required to be the same type.\nAs a rule, the {#N} number trigger can operate on a list, so writing\n\"Exhibits{#N}1{,}2{,}3 and 5\" will result in \"Exhibits 1, 2, 3 and 5\" rather\nthan \"Exhibits 1, two, three and five\" even if you have 1-10 set to written\nout.\nHowever, in some lists or sequences, you may switch to a different type\nof number in the middle, and you want Eclipse to stop forcing digits. So,\nusing the number trigger {#N} to force digits will work for this situation:\nIn Exhibits 3 and 4, 7 and 8, we see a discrepancy\nbut if the numbers change from normal to ordinal, you would want Eclipse to\nstop forcing digits. For example:\nIn Exhibits 3 and 4, seventh and eighth rows contain\nfigures that don't match.\nDelayed and persistent number triggers\nNumber triggers can be delayed, for example {#D>}, allowing you to\napply a trigger to the next number.\nA persistent number trigger is similar, and is written as {#D>>}, but it\napplies to ALL numbers from that point forward until you tell it to stop!\nSo, for example, if you are writing a list of numbers that need to be\nsome sort of unusual format, you can write a persistent number trigger first,\nthen write the list, then write any other non-persistent trigger (such as {#Q}\nfor a plain quantity) and that will turn off the persistent trigger.\n264\n164 Eclipse Help\n9.5.3 Punctuating conditional text\nPunctuating conditional text\nConditional text applies when you have a punctuation that is not\nsupposed to apply if there is already an appropriate punctuation mark there.\nFor example, the {.} entry will not add an extra period after âInc.â or âa.m.â\nThis feature works if the punctuation being added is part of a conflict\nselection or a global replacement during editing, as well as during\ntranslation.\n9.6 Conflicts\nConflicts\nRELATES TO: Conflict AI Dialog\nEclipse uses intelligent conflict resolution to decide how to translate a stroke or\nstroke with multiple possible translations, depending on grammatical context. For\nexample, TAEUBL can translate as \"table\" or \"Table\" depending on whether or not it\nis followed by a number, such as \"Table 12.\" To tell Eclipse the choices you want for\nthis steno, create this dictionary entry: \\table\\Table{N} The {N} tells Eclipse that\nwhen the stroke is followed by a number, it should be in numeral form, not written\nform. When you are translating, and hit TAEUBL, you will see the choices in the\nbottom left-hand corner of your screen: 1:table 2:Table{N} You can also right-click\non a conflict to see the choices.\nIn User settings/Display/Color selections you can set different colors for\nconflicts depending on whether they are computer-selected, user-resolved, or\nUnresolved. In the example below, your is blue, indicating it is a \"Conflict selected\nby the computer,\" table is green, indicating a \"Conflict selected by the user,\" and\n\\table\\Table{N} is orange, indicating a conflict that is not yet resolved.\n184\nDictionaries 165\nConflicts are represented in your dictionary by backslashes (\\), which precede\nthe conflict entry and separate the alternate definitions.\nAs you edit your jobs and select conflicts, Eclipse learns from your choices and\neventually selects the correct conflict for you.\n\\their\\there simple conflict\n\\site\\sight\\cite simple conflict\n\\go\\{^ing} conflict including a suffix as an\nalternate definition (between the word\nâgoâ and the suffix âingâ)\n\\exhibit\\Exhibit{#N\n}\nwill pick choice 2 when it sees\n\"Exhibit 5\"\n(or \"Exhibit A\")\nTo view information about conflicts in your dictionary, right-click any conflict\nentry, and choose Properties.

A document about a survey or a\npercentage of ownership would probably have the word \"stake\" whereas a\ndocument about food or restaurants or expense accounts would probably\nhave the word \"steak.\" There are countless examples like this: \\break\\brake,\n\\rifle\\rival, \\reflex\\reflection, \\paved\\paced, \\peer\\pier, \\principle\\principal,\n\\copies\\copes, \\suite\\sweet...\nGrammatically, there's no possible way to tell the difference. They are\ncompletely interchangeable in any sentence structurally and are only\ndistinguishable by meaning. So we need a way to select these conflicts\nautomatically. You can use Word Cloud Conflict Resolution for these\nspecial cases.\nDictionaries 167\nA statistical analysis of several hundred thousand pages of transcript\nalong with dozens of these context conflicts revealed that there are clearly\nword correlations. The top 50 words appearing in documents along with\n\"braking\" include pavement, rollover, passenger, scratches, broadside,\ntaillight, vehicle, median, etc. The word \"breaking\" is much more subtle,\nsince it can appear in many situations, but it does contain more instances of\nwords such as distress, bone, emotional, overburden, metallurgy,\ncontractors, etc.\nYou can pre-program these conflicts with words that should appear with\nor near the words in question.\nIn a conflict dictionary entry, right-click and select Properties, then\nAdvanced to go to the AI data. There is a Word cloud checkbox that you\ncan use to change a conflict from a grammar conflict to a meaning conflict\n(along with a warning that checking or unchecking this box deletes all\nexisting data for that conflict.)\nYou will be able to identify Word cloud conflicts easily, because they will\nappear with a C and the number of words in the cloud.\n168 Eclipse Help\nBoth grammatical and word cloud conflicts are visible. Eclipse labels word cloud\nsuggestions with a \"C\" in the AI column.\nWith a word cloud conflict, the Add/Modify/Delete buttons allow you\nto add or remove individual words from the list. The list will consist of an\nalphabetized collection of every word that you wish to correlate to a particular\nchoice. Note that in order to save time, you can use the \"Add\" button and\ntype a long list of words separated by commas.\nSo, for example, you could hit Add, select \"brake\" and then type\n\"car,vehicle,pavement,rollover,median,traffic\" and hit Enter to add all of\nthose as words associated with \"brake, \" then hit Add, select \"break\" and\ntype \"bone,nerve,metal,emotion\" and hit Enter to add those as words\nassociated with \"break.\"\nIn order to select these, Eclipse keeps a running list of every word that\nhas been used in a document, how many times it was used and how recently\nit was used. If you write a word cloud conflict, it then looks at the relative\nweight of every single word in the correlation list to see which conflict is\nmore likely to be the right choice in this document.\nNote that how recently the correlated words are used matters, and it is\npossible for the AI to select both choices in a document based on key terms\nbeing used more recently.\nAlso note that there's a special exception for phrases. If a word appears\nexactly before or after the current conflict, it causes the selection to be made\nwithout further analysis. So, for example, if you put \"lucky\" or \"coffee\" or\n\"out\" in the \"break\" words then writing \"lucky break\" or \"coffee break\" or\n\"break out\" will cause \"break\" to be selected 100% of the time, regardless of\nhow many traffic-related terms the job has in it so far. This is a far more\nefficient way to handle conflict phrasing than putting in dozens of dictionary\nentry phrase globals.\nDictionaries 169\nAn online resource that may be useful when you are building your Word\nCloud lists is https://wordassociations.net/en/\n9.6.2 Working with Conflicts\nWorking With CONFLICTS\nRELATES TO: Dictionary entry syntax ,\nAutoMagic: Conflicts and Typeovers .\nA conflict is a dictionary entry that contains two or more definitions. Eclipse has\npowerful conflict-related features.\nDictionary Syntax\nThe syntax is \\choice1\\choice2\nHere are some examples:\nYou may have more than two choices for a conflict; just precede each with a\nbackslash.\nWhen To Use Conflicts\nYou may use a conflict for any two dictionary entries that you'd like to write with\nthe same steno outline. The only requirement is that the conflict choices must be\nmutually exclusive: there cannot be a situation where either choice would be correct.\nIf there is, Eclipse will not be able to learn the conflict.\nIn addition to simple homonyms, conflicts can also be used to resolve stacking\nissues. For example, if you tend to stack the steno PWEU/-T , you could create a\nconflict for PWEUT = \\bit\\by the. This technique can be used in any situation where a\ncommon misstroke of yours is also a dictionary entry of its own.\n958\n403\n170 Eclipse Help\nConflicts can also assist in number conversion . You can make a conflict for\n\\exhibit\\Exhibit{#G}. After you've selected it enough times, not only will Eclipse\nlearn when to use the capitalized and non-capitalized version of the word, but the\n{#G} symbol will automatically convert the exhibit number to digits.\nChoosing Conflicts\nHere is what an unresolved conflict looks like in a transcript:\nTo select a conflict, put the cursor on it, and then press the number of the\ndesired choice. The status bar will show the choices, at bottom left.\nAfter you select a conflict, only the correct choice will appear, and the color will\nchange to that of a human-selected conflict. If you make a mistake, you may simply\nre-select it.\nConflict AI\nEach time you make a conflict selection, an entry is added to the AI table for\nthat conflict. The AI column in the dictionary display will tell you how many\ndifferent times this conflict has been chosen. The AI table for a specific entry can be\nviewed via Dictionary Entry Properties .\nAs you select conflicts in editing, the AI table will grow. After a few choices have\nbeen made, Eclipse will use the AI table to automatically resolve the conflict.\nA computer-selected conflict will show in a different color. You need only select\nthe conflict if Eclipse got it wrong.\nPick First Conflict Choice By Default\nThis option appears on the Translate tab of User Settings. If checked, only\nthe first item in a non-resolved conflict will appear. This is useful if you are doing\ncaptioning , or some other form of realtime output where it would be unwieldy\nfor the entire conflict to be visible. However, it is still an unresolved conflict; you need\nto select it for the AI to learn.\nWhen creating conflicts, you should put the most likely choice first. That gives\nthis feature the best chance at displaying the correct result.\nVISUALIZERS:\n684\n1058\n141\n143\n244\n666 519\nDictionaries 171\nF4 - Conflicts\nF4a - Conflicts Advice\nF5 - Slop Strokes\nvM8 - AutoMagic Conflicts\n9.6.3 Conflict A-I Sharing\nConflict A-I Sharing\nOften, you will have many different stylistic conflicts that should follow\nexactly the same grammatical rules.\nFor example, if you have conflicts for \\page\\Page{#N} and\n\\volume\\Vol.{#R} and \\exhibit\\Exhibit{#N}, those are all pretty much the\nsame in terms of grammar rules.\nThe same goes for conflicts such as \\yes\\{,?}yes{,?} and \\no\\{,?}\nno{,?} and any others that may have different content but identical\ngrammatical contexts.\nFor these items, it is possible to link those conflicts together to share AI\ndata. The way this is done is to pick a single \"master\" conflict, such as KWE\nfor \"yes\" that is going to act as the repository for all similar conflicts.\nThat way, the \"no\" and \"of course\" and \"naturally\" and all of the other\nwords that you might want to put into a \\word\\{,?}word{,?} structure like\n\"yes\" has, can follow the same rules.\nTo assign those other conflicts to use the same rules as the \"yes\"\nconflict, define them like so:\nTPHO = {=KWRE}\\no\\{,?}no{,?}\nIn other words, use the slop stroke syntax, but add on the correct text\nto use. The \"slop stroke\" feature will then know to share the AI data, but use\ndifferent text.\nWhat will happen is that the translator will use the same AI data for\neach of these conflicts, and when you are editing and you pick any of these\nconflicts, the new AI data created by your selection will all go into a central\nplace.\nThe end result will be that these conflicts will all learn much faster and\nbecome more accurate more quickly, and be more consistent, because they\nare not each learning separate rules and are instead sharing a single set of\nrules.\n172 Eclipse Help\n9.6.4 AutoMagic and conflicts\nAutoMagic and conflicts\nYou can create conflicts to improve your translation and reduce editing time, and\nthose conflicts will appear in the AutoMagic window to really speed up your editing.\nIn the example below, AutoMagic recognizes that you might need to capitalize\nState Street, and if you choose to capitalize street, it will automatically capitalize the\nprevious word as well.\nAutoMagic and Conflicts can also help with punctuation. In the following\nexample, AutoMagic offers several ways of punctuating the word, âyes.â\n.\nAutoMagic will also list conflicts to help with hyphenation (eg. Up-to-date),\nnumbers, and number words (number vs. No.). It will also offer additional choices,\nsuch as removing the conflict, or globaling the steno.\nDictionaries 173\n9.7 Adding, Copying, and Moving Dictionary Entries\nAdding, Copying, and Moving Dictionary Entries to\nOther Dictionaries\nTo add dictionary entries to your dictionary in realtime, you can use the\nsteno dialog in keymode.\nIf you are toggled into Keymode in realtime, then strokes on the writer\nwill be transferred directly into the on-screen steno emulator. (See using the\nSteno emulator .) When used in combination with the Edit/Add\nDictionary Entry command in the editor, you can add dictionary entries\nfrom your writer in realtime without having to write the stroke in your job\nfirst.\nYou can create a macro to activate keymode and then execute the Add\nDictionary Entry function in one stroke. Another stroke would press the Enter\nkey for you in order to accept the steno. Since you are in keymode, you can\nfingerspell the entry and then use your âaccept globalâ macro to put it into\nwhatever dictionary you like. Add entry will disable keymode and correction\nmode when you complete the entry or escape from the process.\nSelected dictionary entries can be copied or separated/transferred to\nother dictionaries. Copying (or writing) an entry to another dictionary leaves\nthe entry in the original dictionary and places a duplicate entry in the other,\nor target, dictionary. Separating or transferring an entry is essentially the\nsame as a cut-and-paste operation in a word processor; the entry is removed\nfrom the original dictionary and placed in the target dictionary. For either\noperation, you first need to mark the entries you want to copy or move.\n9.7.1 Add Dictionary Entry\nAdd Dictionary Entry\nCtrl+D\nor Edit/Add dictionary entry..\nAdds an entry to a dictionary . This allows you to put entries in your\ndictionary without having to global them.\nWhen you execute this command, the steno emulator will appear.\nUse the emulator to enter the desired steno.\n893\n672\n326\n893\n174 Eclipse Help\nAfter you have entered the steno, the globaling dialog will appear.\nIf there is already a main dictionary entry that uses that same steno, that\nentry's text will be brought into the text box of the globaling dialog to let you\nknow that it's already in use and how it's defined. To enter a new entry, enter\nthe definition, just as if you were performing a global.\nIf you execute the Add Dictionary Entry command while you are not in a\ndictionary, you will choose the destination from the globaling dialog ,\njust as when doing a global. (Trash and Local are not applicable.)\nIf you executed this command from within a dictionary, the entry will be\nadded to that dictionary. You will not have the option to choose a different\ndictionary.\nIf you have Detect Conflicts turned on, you will be warned if your\nnew entry has the same steno as an existing entry. You will get a message\nsaying that the steno is already in use, and asking if you wish to overwrite,\nmake a conflict, or keep the original entry. Escaping from that error will keep\nthe original entry, and will also ask you if you wish to abort the global\nentirely and start over.\nWhen you are in a dictionary, AutoMagic will offer \"Add dictionary\nentry\" as the choice #2 on the list.\n9.7.2 Selecting Entries for modification\nSelecting Entries for modification\nWith a dictionary open and active, open the Find dictionary entries\nwindow (F5).

Pressing the\nspacebar puts you into a âtaggingâ mode, and your cursor position is\nrepresented by a light outline. Select entries using the spacebar, noting that\nthe only entries that are highlighted are the ones you have actually selected.\nWhile in this mode the only way you can select entries is with the spacebar,\nand you have to hit the [escape] key to get out of it.\nNote, also, that if you click on an entry with the mouse without hitting\nthe Ctrl key that all of your selections will be undone and you will have to\nstart over.\nMarking entries using F7\n176 Eclipse Help\nThe F7 marking feature lets you mark a block of dictionary entries using\nany movement command.To use this method, press F7 to turn on the\nblocking feature and mark entries from the current entry up or down through\nthe entries. As long as the feature is on, any subsequent movement you\nmake with a cursor key will behave as though you are holding the Shift key.\nThis means that you can block lines by using the up and down arrow keys, or\nthe page up or page down keys.\nTo deselect the text and turn off marking, press Esc.\n9.7.4 Copying/writing entries\nCopying/writing entries\nUsing the Write command\nYou can copy entries to an existing dictionary or to a new one. To create\na new dictionary with the Write command, enter a new file name in the file\ndialog window (Step 3 below). A prompt will ask you to confirm the new fileâs\ncreation.\n1. Open the dictionary that has the entries you want to copy.\n2. Highlight the entries you want to copy.\n3. Use the Write command (Alt+W). The Open file dialog opens.\n4.

The marked entries are moved to the target dictionary.\nUsing the Windows Cut command\nThe Windows Cut command, Ctrl+X is another method for moving\nentries from one dictionary to another. Cut removes the entry from the\ncurrent dictionary and places the selection on the clipboard. You can use the\nWindows Paste command (Ctrl+V) to paste the entry to another dictionary\nor to another file.\n1. Highlight the dictionary entries you want to move.\n2. With the entries still selected, use the Windows Cut command\nCtrl+X. The selection is placed on the Windows clipboard.\n3. Open the target dictionary if it isnât already opened.\n4. Use the Windows Paste command Ctrl+V to paste the selection in\nthe dictionary.\nNote that the selection that was cut remains on the Windows Clipboard\nuntil something else is cut or copied; until then, the same selection can be\npasted multiple times. NOTE: If an outline is in both the current and\nimported dictionary, the definition of the copied entry overwrites the one in\nthe target dictionary (the dictionary in which you paste or write the entry),\nunless you have selected Detect conflicts in User Settings/Edit\ntab/Globaling section. If Detect conflicts is selected, when a conflict is\ndetected, a prompt window offers choices: you will be given the opportunity\nto keep the original definition, overwrite it, or create a conflict of the two\ndefinitions.

However, you can manually add an entry by clicking\nAdd or Modify. This will open the Grammar dialog:\n166\n186 Eclipse Help\nFirst, you will be asked to select a grammar context that should\nprecede the conflict. Select a context from the dropdown list at the top, or\nselect a combination of grammar items by checking one or more checkboxes.\nAfter you click OK or press Enter, you will be asked which conflict\nchoice is correct for this situation. Select the desired conflict choice.\nThe grammar dialog will appear again; select the grammar context or\ncombination of grammar items that should follow the conflict. After you click\nOK, your selection will be added to the list, and will be considered each time\nyou write this conflict in the future.\nGlue symbols in Conflict AI\nMany conflicts can contain glue entries. For example, EUFPLT, in some\ntheories is both {S:MR. RIGHT} and {&I}. In general, you would prefer that\nthe software always picks the first choice unless the entry has another glue\nentry on either side.\nDictionaries 187\nHowever, the editor cannot determine what a glue symbol is because\nthat information is not stored in the document, so selecting this conflict\ncannot teach rules based on glue symbols. So, you can use the \"Glue\" option\non the drop-down list for conflicts like this: clear out all the existing AI data,\nmake sure the conflict is \\choice1\\{&gluechoice}, ensure that the \"Pick 1st\nconflict choice\" option is on by default, then go into the entry properties and\nadd just one rule:\nGlue entry {&gluechoice} Glue entry\nThen lock the conflict. That will cause it to pick the glue choice if there\nis a glue entry either on the left or the right, but otherwise it will always pick\nthe first (non-glue) choice.\n9.9 Importing, Merging, and Unmerging Dictionaries\nImporting, Merging, and Unmerging Dictionaries\nEclipse can import dictionaries from Eclipse V.8 format. Dictionaries from other\nCAT programs can be imported, after they are converted to RTF (Rich Text Format),\nSDF (Standard Dictionary Format), or ASCII. (RTF, SDF, and ASCII are often referred\nto as intermediate formats because they represent an intermediate step in the import\nprocess.)\nYou can also combine, or merge, dictionaries. Whether you are importing or\nmerging, the process is the same.\nNOTE: When an outline is in both the current and imported dictionary, the\ndefinition in the imported file overwrites the one in the current dictionary (the merged\ndictionary).\nIf you later unmerge the dictionary, unmerging does not restore entries that\nwere overwritten during the import. To avoid the overwriting, and to create a conflict\ninstead, set the Detect conflicts option in the Globaling section in the User\nSettings/Edit tab.\nNote: You can import ASCII into a dictionary using the conversion wizard. With\na dictionary open, go to Tools/Convert/From another system/Dictionaries, and\nselect ASCII from the list. You can then select the file to import, and Eclipse will\nimport it into your dictionary.\n188 Eclipse Help\nImporting a dictionary into Eclipse\nOpen the Eclipse dictionary into which you want to import the converted\ndictionary. This can be a new dictionary (use F9 and give the dictionary a file name)\nor an existing dictionary whose entries you want to merge with the imported one.\nOnce the dictionary is open, use the File menu/Import command. An Open file\ndialog appears. Use the file dialog to locate the drive and folder with the dictionary or\ndictionaries you want to import.\nIn the drop-down field, select the file format of the dictionary you want to\nimport. The display area will list only those files that are in the selected format.\nDictionaries 189\nIn the display area, double-click on a fileâs name, or select one or more files you\nwant to import, then click OK. A prompt appears asking whether you want to trim\nredundant entries. (Redundant entries are explained below). After you answer the\nprompt, Eclipse begins the dictionary import.\nImporting a Dictionary using Block Read (Alt+R)\nYou can merge dictionaries with the Block menu/Read command (Alt+R).\nBlock/Read inserts a copy of another file into the current file at the cursor location.\nAfter you press Alt+R, a file dialog will appear. Select the file you wish to\ninsert into the current file.\nIf you are using Block/Read to merge dictionaries, it is advisable to have\nDetect Conflicts checked on the Edit tab . If the same steno exists in both\ndictionaries, you will be asked which entry you wish to keep. You also have the option\nto create a conflict of the two entries.\nWhen block reading one dictionary into another, when it detects a conflict\nbetween an incoming entry and an entry already in the current dictionary, there are a\nnumber of options: âOverwrite/Make conflict/Keep original/Stop asking.â If you select\nâStop askingâ you will be asked what to do with ALL of the remaining entries that\nconflict, and will be asked âOverwrite/keep original,â and the answer will be used for\nall remaining items with matching steno. Note that there is no option to create\nconflicts with all of the remaining entries that use the same steno, since that is\nextremely unlikely to be desirable.\nIf you merge dictionaries without using Detect Conflicts, the dictionary that is\nbeing brought in will take precedence.\n969\n309 306\n190 Eclipse Help\n9.9.1 Importing a dictionary into Eclipse\nImporting a dictionary into Eclipse\nOpen the Eclipse dictionary into which you want to import the\nconverted dictionary. This can be a new dictionary (use F9 and give the\ndictionary a file name) or an existing dictionary whose entries you want to\nmerge with the imported one.\nOnce the dictionary is open, use the File menu/Import command. A\nfile dialog appears. Use the file dialog to locate the drive and folder with the\ndictionary or dictionaries you want to import.\nIn the file type drop-down field, select the file format of the dictionary\nyou want to import. The display area will list only those files that are in the\nselected format.\nIn the display area, double-click on a fileâs name, or select one or more\nfiles you want to import, then click Open.\nA prompt appears asking whether you want to trim redundant\nentries . After you answer the prompt, Eclipse begins the dictionary\nimport.\nYou can also merge dictionaries with the Block menu/Read command\n(Alt+R).\n9.9.1.1 Trimming redundant entries\nTrimming redundant entries\nRedundant entries are multi-word, multi-stroke entries that Eclipse\nwould translate correctly using smaller entries and conflict logic. For\nexample, a two-stroke outline for âthe dogâ that is simply the combined\nstrokes for âtheâ and âdogâ is a redundant entry. (Such entries were\nnecessary in earlier CAT systems to resolve conflicts such as \\it\\the.)\nTrimming redundant entries can result in much smaller dictionaries and\nincreased performance.\n190\n392\nDictionaries 191\n9.9.2 Unmerging dictionaries\nUnmerging dictionaries\nThe Edit menu/Unglobal command removes entries from a dictionary\nthat were placed there via a merge command.\nTypically this procedure is performed to âremoveâ a job or special\ndictionary that was merged with a main dictionary for a particular job.\nTo unmerge dictionaries:\nÂ· Open the dictionary containing the merged entries\nÂ· Select Edit/Unglobal.\nÂ· Select the dictionary you want to unmerge from the Open File dialog\nÂ· Click OK\nNOTE: Unmerging does not restore entries that were overwritten during\nan import.\n9.10 Exporting & Converting Eclipse Dictionaries\nExporting & Converting Eclipse Dictionaries\nThe File/Export command allows you to convert and export a complete\ndictionary or part of a dictionary to several file formats.\nIf you have filtered your dictionary, only the filtered entries will be\nexported.\nConverted dictionaries serve as intermediate files that can be imported\nby other programs or writers.\nThis command is also useful for creating a dictionary backup in an\nalternate format.\nDictionaries can also be converted to word lists (uses only the\ndefinitions), useful for instruction, research, archival, and other purposes.\nThe file format options:\nÂ· ASCII is a text file that consists of each entryâs steno outline and text\ndefinition. The output is in the same order as shown on the display\n192 Eclipse Help\nÂ· RTF/CRE preserves the most information from the Eclipse dictionary\nand is the recommended format for exporting to other systems.\nÂ· Custom steno is an automated dictionary export that attempts to\nadapt a non-split dictionary to a splitkey dictionary.\nÂ· Stentura dictionary is the format used by Stentura writers that are\ncapable of displaying realtime translation.\nÂ· Word list is an ASCII text file that contains only the text definitions\nof the dictionary, in the same order as shown on the display.\nÂ· ASCII (text first) is an ASCII file that has the text on the left. The\noutput is in the same order as shown on the display\nÂ· Passport is a Passport dictionary\nTo export a dictionary:\n1. Open the dictionary you want to export.\n2. Use the File menu/Export command (or the Production/Output\nto Ascii command). The Export dictionary dialog opens with a list\nof file formats\n.\n3. Select (click once on) a file format for the exported dictionary. To\nexport only part of the dictionary, click the Start at button. A steno\nwriter emulation window appears. Enter the stroke outline at which\nyou wish to start the exported file and then click OK. The exported\nfile will contain only those entries from the selected outline to the\nlast dictionary entry.\n4. The export to Ascii or Word list will output the dictionary in the\ndisplay order.\n5. The RTF for steno machines is intended for a dictionary export that\nis going to be loaded into a steno machine that contains no logic for\nselecting conflicts. For most conflicts, it's going to be less visually\ndistracting to see the first choice than to see both choices, so this\noption will export the RTF with the first choice substituted for every\nconflict.\n932\nDictionaries 193\n6. Click OK after setting the options in the Export dictionary window.\nA Save file dialog appears.\n7. Type a file name for the new exported dictionary (be sure to give it a\nname you havenât used for a dictionary) and select a location for it.\n8. Click OK to complete the process.\nThe dictionary will export in whatever order it is sorted in at the time\nthe exported file is created.\n9.11 Specifying Current Dictionaries\nSpecifying Current Dictionaries\nWhen you prepare to translate a job you can indicate to which\ndictionaries globals will be added.\nYou can also set in advance which dictionaries should be used by\ndefault.\n9.11.1 Types of dictionaries\nTypes of dictionaries\nThere are several types of dictionaries, categorized by when and how\nthey are used: Main, Job, and user-defined dictionaries.\n194 Eclipse Help\nThe Main dictionary is your core translation dictionary. The main\ndictionary is used in every translation.\nA Job dictionary is automatically created at the time of translation; its\npurpose is to contain steno and terms that are specific or unique to that job\nand unlikely to be needed elsewhere.\nIf a Job dictionary is specified, it is used; if not, a Job dictionary with a\nfile name in the form jobname.dix is created. During translation, Eclipse\ngives preference to job dictionary entries over those in a main dictionary.\nJobs remember what job dictionary they are associated with, even if it is not\nthe dictionary with the same name as the job.\nUser dictionaries (numbers 1 through 8) are usually dictionaries\nspecific to an industry or a category of terms (such as medical, engineering,\nmarine).\n9.11.2 Setting default dictionaries\nSetting default dictionaries\nOpen the User Settings (Alt+U)/User tab.\n1. Click the Dictionaries button. The Dictionaries dialog appears.\n2. Highlight the dictionary you want to work with, and use the buttons to\narrange them, setting the Main dictionary and any additional\ndictionaries you want to use by default.\nDictionaries 195\n3. To add a dictionary to the list, highlight an empty space and click\nAdd... An Open File dialog appears, listing your dictionaries.\n4. Select the dictionary you want to add by clicking on the name, and\nclicking OK or pressing Enter. Once selected, the dictionaryâs filename\nappears in the list. You can add multiple dictionaries by Shift+clicking\nor Ctrl+clicking several filenames. The dictionaries will be added in\nalphabetical order, so to control the order you will either have to add\nthem one at a time or move them around after they're added.\n9.12 Spell Checking a Dictionary\nSpell Checking a Dictionary\nYou can check the spelling of your dictionary entries by using the\nregular spell checker in Eclipse, on the Production menu/Check\nspelling (Shift+Alt+S).\nNote that the spell checker will ignore the steno outlines and look only\nat the definitions. The dictionary spelling checker moves to errors as it\nadvances through the dictionary checking spelling. The one with the invalid\nspelling will be highlighted.\nThe spell check will check each word in a phrase entry.\nDictionary searches are not case sensitive. If a dictionary search\ncontains no capital letters, the search will be case insensitive. Any capital\nletters will cause it to do a case-sensitive search. For example, if you do a\ndictionary search for âbankâ it will find both âbankerâ and âMr. Banksâ but if\nyou search for âBankâ it will only find âMr. Banks.â\nYou can use Alt+S to spell check a single dictionary entry. If there is\nmore than one word in the entry, it will check each word. Correctly spelled\nwords show âword is correctly spelledâ in the status bar, and incorrectly\nspelled words will bring up the spell check suggestions dialog.\n9.13 Searching Dictionaries\nSearching Dictionaries - Overview\nEclipseâs dictionary search allows you to find specific entries or a group\nof entries with the properties that you specify, according to a variety of\ncriteria. After search, you can copy (Write) or transfer (Separate or Move)\nfound entries to another dictionary file.\n379\n196 Eclipse Help\nTo search a dictionary, open it and then press F5 (this is the same way\na search is initiated in a text document). The Find dictionary entries dialog\nwindow opens with your cursor in the Text box. Whatever you type in the\ntext box will filter any entries matching that text.To search for an entry by\ntext definition, begin the search using F5. When you get the Find dictionary\nentries Dialog, enter the text you want to find in the Text field. When you\nclick on OK, Eclipse will search for an exact match to the entered text. For\nexample, if you type âtheâ and hit [enter] it will find any dictionary entries\ncontaining âtheâ in them. Note that this is looking for a match anywhere in\nthe dictionary, so it will not only match \"the\" but \"the dog\" or \"on-the-job\" or\n\"there\" or \"other\" or \"batheâ or any other entry containing that sequence of\nletters.\nThe text search is only case sensitive when the search contains capital\nletters. Otherwise, it is not case sensitive For example, if you do a dictionary\nsearch for âbankâ it will find both âbankerâ and âMr. Banksâ but if you search\nfor âBankâ it will only find âMr. Banksâ.\nYou can use Ctrl+W to add foreign and special characters to the search\nstring.\nThe Find dictionary entries dialog window gives you many options for\nyour search. There are two lists containing Steno shortcuts and Text\nshortcuts to different types of searches you might want to do. Select an\nitem from either one or both of those lists. Some of the searches require no\nadditional input, such as Conflicts which simply shows you all of your\nconflicts. Some of them, such as Starts with will require you to type in some\ntext. Select the item on the list, hit enter or OK, then type the text when it\nasks you to and hit enter. The text will be entered in the find dialog, and you\ncan hit enter or OK to complete the search.\nWhen filtering or sorting a dictionary, the mouse pointer will turn to an\nhourglass to indicate that the software is working.\nThese parameters can be searched individually or in a combination of\none text filter and one steno filter. You can do âfind and replaceâ searches on\ntext and/or steno. The steno and text each have separate replace fields in\nwhich you can type a replacement for the original text. These options are\ndescribed individually below, with more detailed information on custom\nsearches in the Reference Guide.\nIf only the text or only the steno has content typed into both the search\nand replace, the other part of the entry is ignored. For example, if you tell it\nto replace the text â{A:bold}â with â{b}â it will do so for all entries,\nregardless of their steno.\nIf BOTH search boxes contain text, then only entries that match BOTH\nof the search criteria will be considered. In this case, if EITHER of the replace\nboxes contains text, then that text will be used to replace the appropriate\nmatching portion of the entry. If BOTH replace boxes contain text, then that\ntext will be replaced in BOTH of the portions of the entry. For examples, see\nthe Reference Guide.\n197\nDictionaries 197\nWhen you issue a find command, the dictionary display changes by\nfiltering out only those entries that match the criteria you specify and\ndisplaying them exclusively. When you do this, the âStenoâ or âTextâ column\nheaders will change to âSteno (filtered)â or âText (filtered)â to let you know\nyou're not looking at your entire dictionary, but at a subset of the entries in\nit.\nYou can use the up and down arrows to move among the filtered\nentries, and use the column sorting capability to re-sort the filtered entries in\nany order you like. For example, you could display all of your conflicts in\nalphabetical order.\nTo return to viewing the complete dictionary, press F5 and enter\nwithout choosing any parameters.\n9.13.1 Dictionary Search with Filter\nDictionary Search with Filter\nF5/hyperkey F\nRELATES TO: Find , Working With\nDictionaries , Filter Expressions .\nThe dictionary filter allows you to search your dictionary for a particular subset of\ninterest. Rather than the cursor jumping to the matched entries, the dictionary will be\nfiltered, meaning that only matches will be shown.\nTo filter a dictionary, Open the dictionary you wish to filter, and then do a\nFind (F5 or hyperkey F) . The Find Dictionary Entries dialog will appear:\n320\n672 972\n1035\n320\n198 Eclipse Help\nYou can type the desired text or desired steno in the Text: and Steno: boxes.\nOnly exact matches will be displayed. You may also click Go To to open the steno\nemulator for a steno search.\nYou may also type filter expression syntax into either the Steno or Text\nboxes.\nYou can click the Entry no.. button and then supply an entry number and the\ndictionary will jump to that entry number.\nYou can check the Match Comments box and the text search will search both\nthe entry text and the comment text.\nSteno Filter Search\nThe list of Steno Shortcuts at bottom left offers a variety of ways to search the\ndictionary for steno. Here is the list of choices, and what each one does:\nÂ· Any Steno. All entries are shown.\nÂ· Contains Keys. Shows entries that contain the keys you select (you will be\nprompted with the Steno Emulator). For example, if you chose the initial-side keys\nST, you would see STPH={?}, START = start, and PHAOEUBG/ROE/ST-PLS =\nMicrosystems.\nÂ· Contains Strokes. Shows entries that contain the keys you select as an entire\nstroke. This search would result in the entry ST = is it, as well as any entries of two\nor more strokes that contain ST as an entire stroke.\nÂ· Starts with Keys. Shows entries that begin with the steno keys you select. If you\nselect steno keys initial SR, you would see SRAPB = van, but not STR = center\n(since SR are not the first keys of STR).\n893\n972\nDictionaries 199\nÂ· Starts with Strokes. Same as Starts with Keys, but applies to complete steno\nstrokes only. For example, EPB would find EPB/KREUPBT = encrypt, but not EPBD =\nend (since EPB is not a complete stroke in this outline).\nÂ· Ends with Keys and Ends with Strokes. Similar to Starts with Keys and Starts\nwith Strokes.\nÂ· Two Strokes. Shows all two-stroke entries. You will not be asked to select steno\nhere; it will show all of them.\nÂ· At least Two Strokes. Shows all entries of two or more strokes.\nÂ· Three/Four/Five/Six/Seven/Eight Strokes. Similar to Two Strokes.\nÂ· At Least Three/Four/Five/Six/Seven/Eight Strokes. Similar to At least Two\nStrokes.\nÂ· Custom Steno Search. Takes you to the Custom Search Builder dialog, where you\nwill be prompted to build a custom filter. See the page on filter expressions .\nNote: The difference between âkeysâ and âstrokesâ is whether or not youâre\nsearching for an entire stroke in that location or only part of a stroke. Here are some\nexamples:\nSearch provided: Ends with keys AL\nMatches: TAL, TPAL, TPORPL AL, PRAOEUPL AL\nSearch provided : Ends with stroke(s) AL\nMatches: TPORPL AL, PRAOEUPL AL\nDoes not match: TAL, TPAL (it must have AL as an entire stroke at the end)\nText Filters\nYou can also use Text Shortcuts: these filters apply to the definition, not the\nsteno. Here are your options:\nÂ· Any Text. All entries are shown.\nÂ· Contains. The text you enter into the Text box will appear somewhere in the entry.\nSearching for an entry that contains âtheâ would turn up the, theocracy, lathe, the\nbook, and Atherton.\nÂ· Starts With. The text you enter into the Text box will appear at the beginning of\nthe entry. Searching for âtheâ would turn up the, theocracy, and Theodore.\nÂ· Ends With. Similar to Starts with. Searching for âtheâ would turn up lathe and\nbathe.\nÂ· Exact Match. What the name implies; turns up dictionary entries that match the\nentered text exactly.\nÂ· Capitalized. Shows all capitalized dictionary entries.\nÂ· Conflicts. Shows all conflicts.\nÂ· Phrases. Shows all entries that are multi-word phrases, like âthe courtâ and \"United\nNations.\" 262\nÂ· Commands. Shows all dictionary entries that are formatting commands. Note that\nthis will include things like prefixes/suffixes, Q/A/speaker IDs, and punctuation.\nÂ· Prefixes and Suffixes.\nÂ· Internal Caps. Shows all dictionary entries that have a capital letter somewhere\nother than the beginning. All caps entries are not included.\nÂ· Macros. Dictionary entries that execute macros, such as for realtime editing.\nÂ· Digits. Any entry that contains digits 0-9. This will include things like 24-karat and\nI-95.\n979\n200 Eclipse Help\nÂ· Written numbers. Any entry that includes a written number word: one, two, three,\netc.\nÂ· All caps. Entries that are defined in ALL CAPS.\nÂ· Punctuation. Any entry that contains a punctuation mark.\nÂ· Autoincludes.\nÂ· Capitalized Phrases.\nÂ· Paragraphs. Any entry that creates a new paragraph. This includes things like {Q},\n{A}, {N}. and {S:SPEAKER} by themselves, as well as briefs like {A}Yes{,}Your\nHonor.\nÂ· Number Triggers. Any entry that contains a number-conversion code like {#G}.\nÂ· Speakers. Any entry that contains a speaker ID.\nÂ· Lockspaces. Any entry that contains a lock-space.\nÂ· Hyphens. Any entry that contains a hyphen.\nÂ· Defined Slop Strokes. Any entry that uses the {=STKPWHR} slop-stroke syntax.\nNote that slop strokes will not appear here if they do not use this redirecting syntax,\nsuch as STKPWR = {Q}.\nÂ· Glue Entries. Any entry that contains the {&} glue character syntax.\nÂ· One-letter (Alphabets). Any dictionary entry that contains only one letter.\nÂ· Two-choice conflicts. Any conflict entry that offers two choices.\nÂ· Three-Choice Conflicts and Four-Choice Conflicts.\nÂ· Conflicts with Commands, Conflicts with Capitalization, Conflicts w/Prefix\nor Suffix, Conflicts with Number Triggers, Conflicts with Hyphens, Conflicts\nwith Paragraphs, Conflicts with Punctuation. Finds certain conflict dictionary\nentries.\nÂ· And finally, Custom Text Search takes you to the Custom Search Builder dialog,\nwhere you will be prompted to build a custom filter. See the page on filter\nexpressions .\nSearching and Replacing\nIf you want to perform a search and replace, enter what you are searching for in\nthe Search text box, and what you want to replace it with in the Replace text box\nnext to it. You can search-and-replace on text or steno; each has its own box.\nNote that unlike the find, this does not filter the dictionary display. Instead, it\nwill find all matches and ask you for each one if you want to replace it. It will show\nyou the original entry and what the replacement will look like to give you a chance to\nmake sure you are finding and replacing the right thing. You will be asked to confirm\neach entry that is subject to change:\n979\nDictionaries 201\nTo confirm this change, answer Yes. If you do not want this change to be made,\nanswer No. If you select All, all entries that match the search/replace criteria will be\nchanged automatically. Be cautious when using the All option, as it cannot be undone.\nSelecting Cancel will cancel the search and replace.\nWhen searching and replacing, the steno and text filters will also apply. If you\nwant to search-and-replace only entries that end in the letter S, enter \"s\" into the\nSearch box, and select \"Ends With\" in the list of text shortcuts.\nIt is also possible to use both steno and text as a search criteria, even if you\nonly want to change one or the other. A dictionary entry must match both criteria to\nbe affected. The following example would replace the final S steno with a final Z, but\nonly for entries that end in the letter S, and end with the -S (final S) keystroke:\nCreating Custom Filters\nYou may create custom dictionary filters by using filter expressions . See\ndetails in the Reference Guide.\nClearing All Filters\nTo once again view all entries in the dictionary, open the Find dialog (F5), and\npress Enter without selecting anything.

You can also select \"Macros\" from the list in the Text shortcuts\nbox.\n9.13.4 Searching for Steno plus Text\nSearching for Steno plus Text\nIf you type something in BOTH the steno and the text fields, it will only\ndisplay entries that match BOTH the steno and text filters. For example, if\nyou put in AEU and ay in the steno and text fields you would get the\nfollowing results:\nMatches:\nPAEU = pay\nPWAEU ER = Bayer\nTKAEUS = days\nDictionaries 203\nNon-matches:\nRAEUPB = rain\nHAE = hay\nTKOG = dog\nA good example of a useful search: Select âEnds with Stroke(s)â and\nâEnds withâ and hit OK. Put in the final -G stroke, then type âingâ when\nasked for text. That will show you all of the entries in your dictionary that end\nwith the -G stroke and also end in âingâ in the text, allowing you to find old,\nredundant entries that are unnecessary if you have -G defined as the {^ing}\nsuffix.\n9.13.5 More specific Text searches:\nMore specific Text searches:\nHere is a list of the text shortcuts provided for doing more specific text searches.\nText shortcuts:\nAny text\nContains\nStarts with\nEnds with\nExact match\nCapitalized\nConflicts\nPhrases\nCommands\nPrefixes and suffixes\nInternal capitalization\nMacros\nDigits\nWritten numbers\nAll caps\nPunctuation\nAutoincludes\nCapitalized phrases\nParagraphs\nNumber triggers\nSpeakers\nLockspaces\nHyphens\nDefined slop strokes\nGlue entries\nOne letter (alphabets)\nTwo-choice conflicts\nThree-choice conflicts\nFour-choice conflicts\nConflicts with commands\nConflicts with capitalization\nConflicts with prefixes or suffixes\nConflicts with number triggers\nConflicts with hyphens\nConflicts with paragraphs\nConflicts with punctuation\nCustom text search\n9.14 CustomSearch Builder\nCustom Search Builder\n204 Eclipse Help\nAt the bottom of the Steno shortcuts and Text shortcuts lists, you will\nfind Custom steno search and Custom text search. If you choose this\noption, the Custom search builder dialog opens. See the Reference Guide\nfor details on creating a custom search.\n9.15 Dictionary Printing\nDictionary Printing\nAlt+O\nRELATES TO: Dictionaries , Print Dialog ,\nWorking with Dictionaries .\nWhen you right-click in a dictionary, and choose Print, you will be presented\nwith a dictionary Print options dialog, before the Print dialog opens asking about\ndevice details.\n725\n134 601\n672\nDictionaries 205\nThe options in this dialog are Columns, Steno, Number entries, Comments,\nand Dates.\nThe Columns item describes how many columns of dictionary entries you want\nprinted, not how many columns of information. If you select 2, for example, then\nthere will be two columns of dictionary entries, each of which could have a separate\ncolumn of steno and text.\nThe Steno item allows you to decide whether you want no steno, steno in\ncompressed format (as on the display) or steno spread out in paper format. If you\nchoose the paper format, each stroke will be on a separate line. Number entries allows\nyou to decide if you want a column for the entry number as shown on the display.\nComments selects whether you want a column for the entry comments.\nIf you turn on Dates, you will get one date column which will put each available\ndate on a separate line, if applicable. Since many entries may not have a modified or\nused date, this usually will not result in extra lines. When printing the Used date, it\nwill include the number of times used.\nThe contents of the printout and the sizes and orders of the columns are\ndetermined by how you have arranged the display.\nFor example, if your text column is twice as large as the steno column, that's\nhow the printout will appear. Some columns will automatically become a certain size\nbased on the contents. For example, the numbered column will be exactly as large as\nnecessary to hold the largest possible entry number. If you choose paper-style steno,\nthe steno column will be exactly as large as a steno stroke.\nThe dates and times will appear exactly as you have them selected in the\ndisplay, and if you have a search filter or sorting order established, that's what will\nprint.\nIf you have re-organized the order of columns, that's how they will print.\nThe font size is also chosen automatically, proportional to the dictionary display\nfont size, and based on how many columns you have selected. Each time you increase\nthe number of columns, the printing font decreases in size.

The files are named .db0, .db1, .db2, etc. up to .db9, and are\nsaved in the Backup folder. If you have any additional dictionaries selected\nunder User settings/User/Dictionaries, it will also back them up as\ndictname.db0-9.\nYou can access them using File Manager .\nBacking up dictionaries\nIt is impossible to overemphasize the importance of keeping current\nbackups of dictionaries (main, job, and special dictionaries) as well as your\nuser settings and job files. Backups are basically just copies of files that you\nsave in a location other than where the original is. They can be created\nsimply and can save you incredible amounts of time and frustration.\n677\n208 Eclipse Help\nWhile Eclipse makes auto-backups of your main dictionary, current user\nsettings, and job files, you should periodically make backups of all your\ndictionaries, settings, and job files from either within Eclipse, using the Tools\nmenu/Backup , or File Manager (Ctrl+F) , or Windows Explorer, the\nfile management program that is part of the Windows operating system.\nWindows Explorer provides additional functions that are useful for backups.\nSee linked help files (following) for details on each method.\n9.16.1 Backing up and restoring from within Eclipse\nBacking up and restoring from within Eclipse\nEclipse provides a backup wizard to make backing up files especially\neasy. It will ask you which dictionaries and which user files you want to back\nup, and then where you want the backup files to go (hard drive, writer drive,\nauxiliary folder). Another wizard will guide you through the restore process.\n9.16.1.1 Tools/Backup\nTools/Backup\nTo start the Backup wizard, have no dictionaries open, pull down the\nTools menu and select Backup.\n1. The wizard asks what type of files you would like to back up.\n2. Select the file types and click Next.\n3. A new wizard dialog opens asking you to select the files you want to\nbackup. Select the file(s) and click Next.\n4. A new wizard dialog opens asking you to select the location in which to\nplace your backup files. Select the location and click Finish.\n5. The files will be backed up to the selected location.\n208 210 211\nDictionaries 209\nIf you select a removable drive, note that (EXTERNAL) is used to\ndesignate where it is. In order to use this, make sure to define an\nEXTERNAL=path line in your File Locations so that Eclipse knows where\nyour external drive is. Note that you can use the label name feature with\nthis, just as you can with any file location.\n9.16.1.2 Tools/Restore\nTools/Restore\nThe restore wizard is similar to the backup wizard. To start the restore\nwizard, have no dictionaries open, pull down the Tools menu and select\nRestore.\n1. The wizard asks where the files are that you want to restore (floppy,\nhard drive, and auxiliary directory). You can also select Browse from\nthe restore wizard and select any available file location as the\nlocation where the backup files were originally stored.\n839\n908\n210 Eclipse Help\n2. Select the location and click Next. A new wizard dialog opens asking\nyou to select the file you want to restore. Select the file and click\nFinish.\nThe file will be restored to where your Eclipse files are. If the file\nalready exists, Eclipse will prompt before overwriting. If you are restoring\nyour main dictionary, be absolutely certain you are deleting (overwriting) the\ncorrect file.\n9.16.2 Backing up with File Manager\nBacking up with File Manager\nFile Manager is the file management program built into Eclipse. It\nallows you to open, copy, move, rename, delete, zip & unzip, Backup &\nrestore, translate, open, and print files in your user folder or other folders on\nyour computer.\nTo Backup a file or files, select the files in File Manager by clicking in\nthe box beside the file name(s). In the example below, all the âHWâ files and\nthe HWilson Dictionary are marked to be backed up. Click the Backup\nbutton, choose a location for the backup files from the Pick one dialog, and\nClick OK. A File operation complete message will appear.\nYou will receive a warning if a backup of the same name already exists:\nâfilename.zip already exists. Are you sure you want to overwrite it?â\nNote: If you have Windows XP, you can copy files to a disk directly from\nthe file manager as easily as you would to a floppy disk. Select the files you\nwant to burn and use the Copy function. Select Burn to CD as your\ndestination and the files will be burned.\nDictionaries 211\nFor more formation on using File Manager to backup and restore files,\nsee the Reference Guide.\n9.16.3 Backing up and restoring with Windows Explorer\nBacking up and restoring with Windows Explorer\nWindows Explorer is the file management program built into your\ncomputerâs operating system. It allows you to open, copy, move, rename,\nand delete files and folders on your computer, so you can also use it to create\nbackups of your Eclipse files.\nBacking Up\nWhen you back up a dictionary in Windows Explorer, you make a copy\nof the dictionary and place the copy in another location. This location may be\nanother folder on your hard drive, a shared folder on a network, or a disk (or\nsimilar removable media). You do this by right-clicking-and-dragging the file\nto the backup location; right-clicking gives you the option of copying or\nmoving the file.\nBefore you can create a backup with Windows Explorer, you\nmust close the dictionary you want to back up.\nIf you are backing up the main dictionary for your active User folder\nthrough Windows Explorer, you must close Eclipse because the main\ndictionary for any active User folder is always open while the program is\nrunning.\n1. In Eclipse, close your dictionaries. If you are backing up the main\ndictionary, close Eclipse.\n2. If you are backing up another dictionary, make sure that dictionary is\nnot open.\n3. Open Windows Explorer.\n4. Open the folder containing the dictionary file you want to back up\n(the contents of that folder will be displayed in the right pane of the\nExplorer window).\n5. In the left pane of Windows Explorer, locate the drive and folder\nwhere you want to place the backup file.\n6. Right-click-and-drag the dictionary file to the folder where you want\nto put the backup (the target folder). When the target folder is\nhighlighted, release the mouse button.\n7. When you release the right mouse button, a shortcut menu appears.\nSelect Copy here.\n744\n212 Eclipse Help\nOPTIONS: Open the folder containing the backup and edit the backupâs\nfilename. Renaming your backups allows you to create multiple backups for\nthe same dictionary. For example, you might want to add the date to the\ndictionary file so you can see easily when it was created.\nRestoring\n1. Copy the backup to the original dictionaryâs folder by dragging the\nfile from the right Explorer pane to the left.\n2. If your backup has the same filename as the current dictionary, a\nprompt asks whether you want to replace the current file. Select\nYes.\n3. If your backup has a filename different from that of the dictionary,\ndelete the dictionary (click on it and press Delete), then rename the\nbackup to the original dictionaryâs name.\nOnce the dictionary is copied and renamed as necessary, you can use it.\n9.17 Font Changes in Dictionary Entries\nFont Changes in Dictionary Entries\nYou can put commands in your dictionary for changing fonts, for\nexample, to mark where italicizing of text should start and stop.\nDictionaries 213\nThe easiest way to do this is to preset your master font list (User\nsettings/Document/Advanced/Master font table) with the fonts you use\nall the time. For example, use a standard Courier along with underscored,\nbold, and italicized versionsâperhaps also a fancy proportional font for\nheaders or footers. Remember that any new documents will be created with\nthese default fonts. In the example below, Courier New has been set as the\nmaster font.With these default fonts set, you can create dictionary entries\nthat refer to them by number. For example, hereâs an entry that would put\nthe words âThe New York Timesâ in italic Courier New (font #3 in the\nAvailable Fonts dialog shown above), and then return to font 0 (the default)\nwhen done:\n{FN:3}The New York Times{FN:0}\nAn alternate, and more complicated, way to use fonts in dictionary\nentries is to specify the full font information in the dictionary entry using âF:â\ninstead of âFNâ (which allows you to refer to fonts in the Master Fonts list by\nnumber):\n{F:name,size[,weight[,offset[,underscore][,italic][,strikeout]]]}\nFor example,\n{F: Courier New,13,400,0,italic}\nThe name must match an existing font name; if it doesnât, Eclipse will\napproximate a font and the results might not be what you expected or want.\nItems in the brackets are optional items. Note that the nesting of the\nbrackets indicates when you must use a prior optional setting in order to use\nan additional one (for example, to use âoffsetâ you must first specify\nâweightâ).\nHeight numbers refer to âpointsâ; for example 13 point Courier New is\n10-pitch.\nWeight determines boldness; 400 is normal, 700 is bold, and you can\nuse any value, larger or smaller (1000 for super-bold or 100 for very thin,\netc.). Not every font supports every value, but scalable true-type fonts tend\nto support quite a few.\nOffset is for subscripts and superscripts and is the number of twips\nthat the text is raised or lowered from the base line of text. Positive numbers\ncreate superscript (the number of twips the text is raised above the line) and\nnegative numbers create subscript (number of twips below the line).\nNote that even though size, etc. is optional, you MUST put in all values\nleading up to the value you want to change. You cannot skip items. (The\nexception to this rule is that underscore, italics, and strikeout can be placed\narbitrarily in any combination at the end as long as all of the numeric\nattributes are in place.)\nFont command examples\n{F:Courier New,16} is allowed.\n{F:Courier New,10,700,-80} is allowed (bold subscript).\n214 Eclipse Help\n{F:Courier New,10,underscore} is not allowed because to use\nunderscore you must also indicate the weight and offset.\nSo, to use a normal weight and no offset with the underscore, you\nwould use {F:Courier New,10,400,0, underscore} for the entry.\nFont color\nIf you change the color for any of the font selections, that color will be\nused during the printing process if you have a color printer. Note that this\ndoes NOT mean that it will print out the colors defined in the User\nSettings/Display settings.\n9.18 AutoMagic and Dictionaries\nAutoMagic in a Dictionary\nRELATES TO: AutoMagic , Working with\nDictionaries .\nIf you open a new dictionary with no entries in it, AutoMagic will:\nÂ· offer to add, delete, and change entries\nÂ· let you press 2 to Add dictionary entries using your computer keyboard\nÂ· offer to Import a file, or Read a dictionary.\nIf you are in an existing dictionary with several entries marked, Automagic\nsuggests deleting, cutting, copying, writing, separating, or printing the entries.\n52\n672\nDictionaries 215\nIf your cursor is on an entry, AutoMagic allows you to find entries, add an\nentry, delete or modify the entry, or print, among others.\nIf you choose 1 Find entries, AutoMagic suggests the most common search\ntypes.

This process is generally called âreading notes.â The resulting computer\nfile has a â.notâ file extension and is called a notes or note file. Once youâve\nread your notes into a file, you can look at it and see your steno strokes, just\nas if you were looking at the steno tape. When Eclipse translates the note\nfile, it doesnât change any of the steno; it writes the translation to a different\nfile (sometimes known as an English file, text file, or transcript) which has\nâ.eclâ as its file extension. To do the translation, Eclipse uses one or more\ndictionaries to determine how to translate your outlines to text. You can do\nthe translation concurrently with the reading process (as in the case of\nrealtime writing), or you can store the note files and postpone translation\nindefinitely.\nYou can also work directly in note files and perform operations that may\nimprove subsequent translation. For example, before translating a file you\ncan use its outlines to create dictionary entries; defining entries before you\ntranslate can speed up your translation, and make it more accurate.\n224 Eclipse Help\n11 Working with Note Files\nWorking With Note Files\nRELATES TO: Read Notes , Translate Notes , Open\nNotes .\nNotes files are raw steno files. Usually, they are created by reading notes\nfrom your steno machine into Eclipse. Even after you translate a note file, the raw\nnote file itself will remain. A realtime job will also produce a note file. Note files\nhave an .NOT extension , and can be retranslated.\nWhen a note file is open, you can quickly translate it by pressing Alt+T. You\nwill be taken to the Translate Notes dialog, with the current note file already\nselected.\nAlt+M will toggle Translate Mode on and off. When Translate Mode is active,\na translated version of the raw steno will appear at right. When it is off, you will see\nphonetics instead.\nThe following Eclipse editing actions can also be done on note files:\nÂ· Moving around , using the applicable basic cursor movements .\nÂ· You can perform globals from within a note file, just as you would in a text\nfile .\nÂ· Block read , block write , and other block operations can be performed\non note files, allowing you to merge or split them quickly.\nÂ· You can search a note file. Enter the desired steno into the steno\nemulator .\nÂ· You can go to a stroke or fold number.\nÂ· You can add new steno outlines to a note file by using the Add Dictionary\nEntry command (Ctrl+D). The steno emulator will appear, and any\nsteno strokes you enter will be added to the end of the note file. This allows\nyou to create and add to steno files without having a machine present,\nperhaps for educational or testing purposes.\nÂ· You can run Tools/Job report while in a note file, and get statistics just\nbased on the notes. This includes the total number of strokes, the total\nnumber of strokes deleted, and then a breakdown of the number of times\neach key was pressed, the number of times each key was deleted, and a\nproportional comparison of the two accurate to five decimal places (since you\nprobably care more about how often you delete a particular key compared to\nother keys, rather than the pure number of times you deleted it.)\n230 269\n232\n230\n269\n483\n971\n269\n358\n236 312\n326\n694\n392 393 392\n320\n893\n988\n173 893\nWorking with Note Files 225\nin the example above, the reporter hit the K key 2699 times, of which 15 times\nwere deleted.

If your writer is realtime-capable, your notes can be\nsent directly to your computer through a cable. Many writers also store notes on a\nvariety of storage media, such as floppy disks, PCMCIA cards, SD cards, USB drives,\nor even cassettes. To read such notes, you might be able to transfer the storage\nmedia itself from the writer to the computer (put the floppy disk or PCMCIA card in\nyour computer and read the notes from it), or you might need to dump the notes to\nthe computer via a cable.\nSetting up Eclipse to read your notes\nSetting up Eclipse to read notes is usually a simple task and one youâll need to\ndo only once unless you change writers. The necessary settings are saved as part of\nyour user settings, so unless you change writers or the way notes are stored, you\nwonât need to change those settings. If your work requires you to read notes in more\nthan one way (such as over a cable for realtime jobs and from a disk for conventional\njobs), you can create a separate user setting (called a user profile) for each situation.\nNote: Your writer may have additional controls that need to be set when reading\nnotesâcheck your writerâs documentation for such information.\nGo to User Settings/Input to specify how Eclipse receives steno input, either\nfor reading notes or realtime .\n99\n230 483 151\n40\n230 483\nWorking with Note Files 227\nInput Options\nSelect your brand of steno machine from the Writer drop-down list.

NOTE: each command must be a one-stroke entry, and\ncannot conflict with any entry in your dictionary (with one exception).\nDelete is the delete stroke. The default stroke is the asterisk key.\nAutomark is useful for marking a position in your notes. You may then\nsearch for the automarks, in either the text file or the note file .\nThe Display text box below the Automark button dictates how the Automark\nstroke will look. You can set this to any text you like. The default is (Mark). If you set\nit to {NULL}, it will allow you to have a spot marked in your document WITHOUT it\nshowing up as words that need to be deleted or that you don't want to display on a\nrealtime client's screen. To return to the spot, use Hyperkeys v (for forward) and r (for\nreverse), and select choice F, which searches for a flagged spot. A flagged spot is\nanywhere in your document where an AutoMark was inserted.\nThe Automark stroke is also used when building a dictionary .\nThe Keymode and Correction strokes allows you to toggle these modes on and\noff. Keymode and Correction Mode are used in realtime editing .\nThe Division stroke is used to separate jobs on older writers that do not divide\njobs among multiple files.\n320 694 224\n151\n494\n230 Eclipse Help\nThe Spell Mode stroke will toggle Spell Mode on and off. When it is on, your\nwriter keys will be used to fingerspell words, rather than translating against your\ndictionaries. If Capitalize spell mode is checked, these will appear as capital letters.\nThe Stitch Mode stroke will toggle Stitch Mode on and off. When it is on,\nanything you write will be S-T-I-T-C-H-E-D. If Capitalize stitch mode is checked,\nthese will appear as capital letters. If you are captioning, or using CART, and need a\nword to appear stitched immediately, you can hit {STITCH} and follow it with any\ndictionary entry, which will appear stitched. The metadictionary entry for this is:\n{STITCH}={/?STN}\nWhen using spell mode or stitch mode, every stroke is interpreted phonetically,\nmeaning that you can fingerspell something like âwidgetâ with two strokes (WEUD\nTKPWET) instead of six. Normally, you have to hit the spell mode or stitch mode\ntoggle stroke to turn them off. In these modes, as a backup in case you misstroke or\nforget to toggle it off, hitting certain extremely common strokes is used by the\nsoftware as an indication that you are done spelling. The strokes are those in the\nTranslation Magic rules list, which you can edit.\nVISUALIZERS:\nD3 - Realtime Setup\nD3 - Add Serial Port\nD3 - Device Manager\nD1a - Extended Steno\nD1a - Steno KeyMap\nD1a - Extended Steno Dictionary\n11.2 Read Notes\nRead Notes\nAlt+I\nProduction/Read notes..\nRELATES TO: Translating , Note Files .\nIf you are not doing a realtime job, producing a transcript in Eclipse is a twostep\nprocess.

When you import an ASCII\nfile, it will look for timecodes and import them if found.\nTo Import a note file:\n1. Open an empty note file, by going to Open Notes and typing a new\nname in the Name text box. Click OK.\n2. Select File/Import. The Open File dialog opens. From the\ndropdown list,\nselect ASCII\n(*.txt) or Rich\nText Format/CRE\n(*.rtf) as the file\ntype.\n3. If you are\nimporting an rtf\nfile, you will get a\n\"Please wait\" dialog\nwhile the file is converted.\n4. Note: You can import a note file from an RTF file even if that RTF file\nis an export of a document. That's helpful not only to recover notes if\nyou have a document but no note file, but it's also a good way to get\nnotes from ProCAT's Stylus writer which makes an RTF file on its SD\ncard.\n11.8 Globaling in a Note File\nGlobaling in a Note File\nAs mentioned earlier, before translating a file you can use its outlines to\ncreate dictionary entries; defining entries before you translate might not only\nspeed translation but also make the translation more accurate, thus more\nefficient. You might want to set up Speaker names, or special terminology\nand global those items in your notes, adding them to your dictionary before\nyou translate. When you do, you can select a dictionary using the drop-down\nlist, or browsing for any dictionary you want to use.\n242 Eclipse Help\n11.9 AutoMagic and Notes\nAutoMagic in a Notes File\nRELATES TO: AutoMagic , Note files\nWorking with Note files .\nWith a note file open, the choices in AutoMagic include Find (search for steno),\nGo to (a stroke or fold), Append note file, Global, Print, and others.

When you are translating\na file, whether doing Realtime, or Tran and Edit, you can use Connection\nMagic to connect with any number of users, to do shared editing, or to share\nyour document with clients and others using Bridge mobile, over an internet\nconnection or a local network. You can set up a portable wifi router, to set up\na local connection that doesn't rely on the internet. You can also use\nConnectify to turn your PC into a wifi hotspot so you can connect to nearby\ndevices and even share your internet connection. As of Version 10,\nConnectify is built-in to Eclipse.\nÂ· To use Connection Magic, you must be connected to the internet or a\nLAN (Local Area Network), or use Connectify. Details on using\nConnection Magic on a LAN are in the Reference section .\nÂ· To begin a shared editing session with a scopist or other user, you\nmust have a document on the screen.\nÂ· If you choose output to Bridge Mobile, you will decide when you start\nthe session whether you will use the internet or LAN.\nFor details on setting up and using Connection Magic, see this help\npage.\n12.3 Translate Tab\nTranslate Tab\n244\n269\n487\n723\n532\nTranslation 245\nRELATES TO: Translation , Translate\nNotes .\nAs the name implies, the Translate tab of User settings contains options\nrelevant to translating .\nTie Related Items - To ensure that certain word combinations, such as titles\nand names, print on the same line, mark the Tie related items checkbox. When\nchecked, will automatically insert a lock-space between titles and names, such as\nMrs.{~}Smith, and between numbers and measurements, such as 10{~}pounds.\nUntran Borders - If you want to enclose untranslates in parentheses or another\ncharacter, type the desired character in the two Untran borders fields. Type the\nopening character in the field to the left of KPH-PL and the closing character in the\nfield to the right of it. Type only one character in each field. This will not affect\nglobaling in any way; it is an aesthetic choice only.\nIf Phonetic Untranslates is checked, your untranslates will appear\nphonetically. If not, they will appear as raw steno. The pending translation will also be\nphonetic, independent of the Translation Magic setting. The User\nsettings/realtime/pending translation display is controlled by whether User\nsettings/translate/phonetic untranslates is on or off-- if it is on, you will see the\nphonetics before it translates, instead of the raw steno. Turn it off to see the raw\nsteno\n243\n269\n243\n378\n326\n246 Eclipse Help\nYou may select either Basic or Intelligent phonetics from the Phonetic Type list.\nWhen Intelligent phonetics are selected, Eclipse will use the rules in the Phonetics\nTable to attempt to correctly spell the word. You can modify your Phonetics table to\nmatch your steno theory.\nBasic will give you a simple phonetics, and will not attempt to spell the word\ncorrectly.\nIf Suppress Untranslates is checked, untranslates will act like normal text.\nThat is, the untranslate color will be the same as your regular text, and you will\nNOT be able to scan to them. When it is off, untranslates will continue to appear in\nuntranslate text, no matter what the color, so that you can still detect and scan to\nthem.\nInsert Missing By-Lines - If you fail to write a by-line in a situation where it\nis called for, the Insert Missing By-Lines feature, if checked, will insert it for you,\nusing the last By line that was written. As long as you write the first by-whom\nindication, {S:MR. SMITH}{Q} for example, from that point forward any {Q} that is\nwritten that doesn't follow an answer or answer paragraph will automatically have a\nby format applied to it.\nIt will default to using the QS by format, typically defined as âQ (By Mr. Smith)â\nbut if you would prefer that it use the SQ by format, simply leave blank the QS by\nformat template in the settings under User settings/Edit/âByâ formats .\nThis feature will supply missing answer by lines as well as missing question by\nlines, and will correctly supply the appropriate speaker separator in each case.\nIf a missing by line is detected before any manual by lines have been written,\nthe software will supply a default name instead of a âByâ with no name at all. For Q by\nlines, the default name will be âQUESTIONERâ and for A by lines, the default name\nwill be âWITNESS.â Note that either of these can be replaced with whatever you wish\nby specifying a replacement in the speaker table for this exact text.\nTuck Punctuation Inside Quotes will tuck commas, periods, and suffixes\n(including the suffix \"'s\") inside quotation marks. For example, if you write âwidgetâ\nfollowed by {^ize} you will get âwidgetizeâ or if you write âNewsweekâ followed by\n{^'s} you will get âNewsweek's.â\nNote that the 's suffix can be written as {^'s} like any other suffix rather than\nhaving to define it differently as 's or {'s}. In fact, in order to have it work for the\ntuck function, it must be defined as a suffix.\nTuck punctuation is disabled following a digit. So if someone says [he was about\nfive feet eight inches] it would translate as [He was about 5'8\"] and not [He was\nabout 5'8.\"].\nIf you turn Integral affix on, the translator will attempt to apply the integral\nprefixes and suffixes during translation (including Realtime) rather than only using\nthem during globaling or adding a dictionary entry. For example, if you have \"EBGS\nPERT = expert\" in your main dictionary, you can write EBGS PERTS and get \"experts\"\neven if that definition is not in your dictionary.\nNote that it does require that the resulting word be a correctly spelled one or it\nwon't apply the integral prefix or suffix.\n858\n125\n339\n464\n464\n249\nTranslation 247\nThis follows precisely the same rules as the integral prefixes and suffixes used\nduring globaling.\nThe system assumes that if you write TPHROB REUPB ARGD and you only have\nâTPHROB REUPB ARG = flobrinargâ in your dictionary, you were probably trying to\nwrite âflobrinarged.â\nFor details, see the Reference Guide .\nTo the right of the Integral affix option there is a Setup.. button that will\ndirectly open up the editor window for the Integral prefix and suffix steno\ndefinitions list, which is also found on the User settings/Programming tab.\nIntegral affix as: If a word is translated by virtue of the integral prefix/suffix\nfeature, you can choose a text type whose color will call attention to the fact that it\nwas translated without a perfect match in the dictionary. Select from the dropdown\nlist of text types: Normal, Untranslate, Conflict, Selected confilct, AI-selected conflict,\netc., or one of the 8 User-definable text types.\nConvert Answer To: - Often, reporters will write \"Answer\" when \"THE\nWITNESS\" is needed transitioning from colloquy to Q & A. To have Eclipse\nautomatically correct this, check the Convert ANSWER to: box and enter what you\nwant it to change to in the box to the right.\nIf a paragraph translates which is set to behave as âQuestionâ then the next\nanswer will be translated as an answer. If a paragraph translates which is set to\nbehave as âColloquyâ then the next answer will translate as âTHE WITNESSâ or\nwhatever you have typed in the Convert ANSWER to: box.\nTranslation Magic lets you write long words that you do not have defined in\nyour dictionary. Just write words phonetically and they'll translate correctly. Using\nTranslation magic in addition to Fix misstrokes during translation, will give you\nreliable translations for multi-stroke words containing misstrokes. It will apply\nDragged and Dropped keys to multiple steno strokes, and will ignore digits, Macros,\n{DELETE}, {FLUSH}, and automark. For details, see the Translation Magic help\npage and the related Visualizers .\nPick 1st Conflict Choice By Default will display only the first choice in a\nconflict , if the conflict cannot be resolved automatically. This is useful in\ncaptioning , and other realtime situations where it would be unwieldy for the\nviewers to see the entire conflict.\nPick 1st Conflict Choice By Default is simply a display setting. It is still\nconsidered an unresolved conflict, and no information will go to the conflict-resolution\nAI until you manually select it. Remember when creating conflicts to always insert the\nmost commonly appearing conflict first to get the greatest benefit from this feature.\nSuppress double paragraphs - This will convert any double paragraph label\ninto a simple continuation paragraph. In other words, if you are already in a Question\nor question continuation paragraph, then hitting a {Q} will change it into {N}\nautomatically.\nLikewise, hitting {A} will be changed to {N} if you're already within an answer,\nand hitting {S:Name} will change to {N} if you write a {S:Name} entry with exactly\nthe same name in it.\n846\n869\n278\n278 249\n169\n666\n248 Eclipse Help\nThe Master Speaker List button will open the Speaker List , where you can\nmanage your speaker IDs before beginning a translation.\nNon-Capping Words is a list of words, separated by commas, that will not\ncapitalize as part of titles. For example, if you block mark the phrase \"a tale of two\ncities\", and then use the Upper Case command , the word \"of\" will not capitalize\nbecause it is in the Non-Capping Words list.\nNumber bar untrans feature causes all number bar entries to appear as\nuntranslates unless they are specifically defined in your dictionary, just like any other\nsteno stroke.\nNormally, Eclipse considers any number you write with the number bar that\ncontains only digits to be a valid translation, regardless of whether it appears in the\ndictionary or not. You may prefer that a number bar entry, even if it only contains\ndigits, to be considered an untranslate unless you specifically have a dictionary entry\nfor it.\nFor example, you may work with a theory in which you can hit two number keys\nat once to make numbers such as 23, but you never intentionally hit three numbers at\nonce, such as 234, and would like for this to appear as an untranslate.\nKeep in mind that if you turn this on and you do want to use the number bar\nintentionally, you will need to make dictionary entries (like 5 = 5) for every possible\nnumber bar stroke that you would write in your theory.\nMisstroke Setup\nIn your User settings/Translate tab you can enter the keys you most often\nmisstroke by dragging or dropping. When you turn on a misstroke correction feature,\nEclipse can automatically corrects some of these errors. All these options are on in the\nMisstroke Setup section (bottom half of the dialog).\nWhen evaluating a misstroke, Eclipse will sort by frequency, by (internally)\nmaking a list of all of the entries that the current untranslate could be a misstroke for\nand choosing the one that is used with the highest frequency, based on information in\nthe dictionary.\nIf Fix Misstrokes During Translation is checked, Eclipse will attempt to\ncorrect any misstrokes you write when globaling or during translation. The program\nwill use the Dragged Keys and Dropped Keys settings, trying one key at a time, until\nit finds a valid dictionary entry that is close to your misstroke. If a valid entry is\nfound, that entry will translate. The text will appear in the untranslate color you\ndesignate for untranslates (on the User Settings/Display tab), so that you can check\nthem during the editing process.\nTo set your Dragged Keys, click the Dragged Keys button. The steno emulator\nwill appear. Click only the keys you tend to drag. To de-select a key, click it again.\nWhen you are satisfied with your selections, click OK. The keys you chose will appear\nas text to the right of the Dragged Keys button.\nNote: If you do not use the number bar normally and generally hit it only by\naccident, you can turn on the number bar in your dragged keys, and any untran that\ncontains the number bar will attempt to translate without the number bar regardless\nof what other keys have been pressed (as long as the stroke is not all numbers, which\nwill still translate as a number).\n249\n394\n357\n893\nTranslation 249\nUse the same technique to select your Dropped Keys. Click the button at left,\nuse the steno emulator to select, and use the text display to confirm your choices.\nWARNING: When selecting Dropped Keys, be sure to select only those keys you\ntend to drop. If you select all the keys, you may get unexpected results when Eclipse\ntries to resolve dropped-key situations. (Dragged Keys are less critical in this regard.)\nVISUALIZERS:\nD2 - Translation Options Untrans: Translation Magic\nE4aa - Speaker Prep\nE4b - By-Lines\nE4bb - Insert Missing By-Lines\nF4a - Conflicts Advice\nE3a - Translation Magic Customization\nC1 - Phonetics\n12.3.1 Speaker List\nSpeaker List\nRELATES TO: Insert/Modify\nParagraph , Insert Speaker Paragraph\n(F2) , Translate tab .\nThe Speaker List is used for any operation involving speaker IDs. It opens each\ntime you do one of the following:\nÂ· insert a Speaker paragraph using the F2 or F8 speed keys\nÂ· change a different paragraph style to a Speaker (Home-Home-F8)\nÂ· pre-assign speaker names from the Speaker List button on the Translate\ntab of User Settings.\n344\n349 244\n349 344\n345\n248\n250 Eclipse Help\nTo set up your default Speaker List, go to the Translate tab of User Settings,\nand click the Speaker list button. The information you enter here will appear each\ntime you open a new job in that User. By default, the 0 slot is assigned to THE\nWITNESS.\nThis dialog has several columns of information:\nCurrent -- The current speaker name text that the master will be changed into,\nsuch as Mr. Jones or Mr. Smith.\nMaster -- The master speaker name text for those who use standardized tokens\nfor their speaker names, such as SPEAKER 1, SNOO or MR. LEFT.\nGroup -- The group to which the speaker belongs. It's an arbitrary assignment\nthat will be useful for things like the timekeeper report (see page 501) and the search\nfunction. For example, you could put all of your plaintiff's attorneys in group 1 and\nyour defendant's attorneys in group 2. You can then enter a name for the Group\nnumber, and the name will appear in the Group column.\nShortcut -- The unmarked first column in the table is the shortcut. Normally,\nthe first ten speakers have shortcuts of 0 through 9, which are user-definable, so you\ncan change them to letters, use multiple digits or letters, or whatever you like.\nTranslation 251\nYou will notice that the shortcut column also has a box in it. That's the speaker\ncolor. If you define it as anything other than black, that will be that particular\nspeaker's display color, allowing you to make each individual speaker name a different\ncolor. (Note: if you have set paragraph font colors, they will override speaker colors.)\nIf you give speaker names in the speaker table individual colors, those colors will also\napply to the by lines containing those speakers.\nThe Speaker list prompt box -- When you first enter this dialog, your cursor is\nin a prompt box at the top of the dialog. As you type letters or other characters into\nthis box, the dialog attempts to match it with the shortcut text. If it matches the\nshortcut text, and there are no other longer shortcuts starting with the same text, it\nwill select that speaker immediately, and close the dialog. If you type text that does\nnot match any shortcut, but does match a speaker name, the highlight bar will move\nto the speaker that matches what you have typed so far. You can hit [enter] to select\nthe highlighted speaker.\nIf you continue to type so that what you are typing no longer matches any of the\nspeakers on the list, the highlight bar will move to the first available empty CURRENT\nspeaker, the intention being to fill the new name into that slot once you hit [enter].\nThe Move up and Move down buttons can be used to reorder the speakers in\nthe Speaker list. (You can also use Ctrl+up and Ctrl+down.) If you do want to type a\nnew speaker but you do not want it to go into the first available slot, after you're\nfinished typing the speaker name, use the down arrow to move the highlight bar to\nthe row where you do want the speaker to be assigned. In addition to the abilities to\nchange the color and shortcuts, this dialog also offers the ability to change the\nmaster-to-current speaker assignments in realtime by hitting F2 and using the\nChange function.\nYou can use this list to set up standard speaker designations in such a way that\nyou will be automatically prompted at the beginning of each translation for how those\nspeakers should translate. If you set up the Speaker list on the Translate tab so that\nthere is a Master column entry with no Current entry, you will be prompted at the\nbeginning of your translation.\nIf the Current and Master entries are the same, and you move the speaker up or\ndown, both will be moved. If Current is empty and Master is not, the Master will be\nmoved. However, if both Current and Master are populated, but different, when you\nmove the Speaker, only the Current speaker name will move, assuming you are rearranging\nwhich name is assigned to which master speaker designation. In the\nexample below, if you move MR. SMITH down, he becomes SPEAKER 2. If you move\nMR. ROBERTS, the master designation of MR. ROBERTS goes with him.\n252 Eclipse Help\nIf the Load from job dictionary option is selected, the current column will be\nfilled in automatically at the start of a job, as long as steno is defined in the main\ndictionary as a master column speaker, and that same steno is defined as a speaker in\nthe job dictionary. In this case, every entry in the Master column would have a\ncorresponding entry in the Current column at the start of the job.\nWhen you have the job dictionary \"load from\" and \"save in\" options turned on in\nthe speaker table, it always saves the table entries for future assignments. If you\nsimply type a new speaker such as MR. GREEN, that speaker will also get added to\nthe speaker table if you translate a job using that job dictionary, whether it's\nassociated with a master speaker or not. That has no effect on translation, but can\nmake the editing process more convenient since those speakers are immediately\navailable for the insert speaker editing command.\nWhen each Master entry has a Current entry at the start of a job, you will not be\nprompted to add speakers at the beginning of the job.\nSelecting a Speaker\nIf you are editing a transcript, and you pressed F2 to insert a Speaker\nparagraph , or if you changed a different paragraph style to a Speaker , the\nSpeaker List will appear. Select the name of the desired speaker by pressing its\nshortcut key, from the left-most column. In the above graphic, pressing 2 would\ninsert MR. SMITH, pressing 4 would insert MR. BROWN, etc.\n349 345\nTranslation 253\nYou may also select a speaker from the list by typing the beginning of the\nspeaker's name. Type as much as necessary to distinguish it from the others. In the\nabove graphic, typing MR. B would highlight MR. BROWN. You may then press Enter\nto select it.\nIt is also possible to select an existing speaker from the Speaker List by using\nthe Up/Down Arrow keys and Enter, or by using the mouse.\nRenaming A Speaker\nIf you use generic speaker designations and need to change them to the correct\nnames for this transcript, or if you have mis-spelled the name of a speaker, you can\nuse the Speaker list to rename a speaker.\nTo do this:\n1. Press F2 to open the Speaker list.\n2. Using the arrow keys, highlight the name of the speaker you wish to change..\n3. Click Change. (The fastest way to do this is to press Alt+C, to activate the\nunderlined letter.) The Speaker data dialog will appear:\n4. Type the desired name in the Current box, and then click OK or press Enter.\n5. You will be asked if you want the change to affect the entire job, the marked\nblock, or just from this point forward. All will change every instance of this\nspeaker ID in the entire file. Block will change it for the marked block (It will\nalert you if you click Block but have not marked a block). Forward will only\nchange it from this point forward. Cancel will cancel the change entirely.\n259\n254 Eclipse Help\n6. You will be returned to the Speaker list. Press Escape to close it. (If you\npress Enter, a new Speaker paragraph will be inserted.)\n7. If you change a speaker during realtime, with a Bridge output with Apply\nedits turned on, each speaker paragraph using the changed speaker will be\nre-transmitted to the Bridge output.\nRe-Assigning a Speaker\nIf an incorrect speaker is assigned, use the technique for changing a paragraph\nstyle to change it to a Speaker. You will be asked to re-select the speaker's name.\nThis is not the same as renaming a speaker. Renaming a speaker changes the\nname of an existing speaker to something else, in multiple locations throughout the\ntranscript. Re-assigning a speaker will change the identification of the person\nspeaking, for that location only. You would re-assign a speaker only if the words in the\nparagraph are assigned to the wrong speaker, e.g., you wrote {S:MR. SMITH} when\nthe speaker was actually {S:MR. JONES}.\nAssigning Speaker Names\nIf you use generic speaker identifiers, you can use the Master column of the\nSpeaker list to pre-assign specific names for each job.\nFor example, if you have the following entries in your dictionary:\nYou can click the Speaker List button on the Translate Tab , and enter the\ngeneric designations SPEAKER 1, SPEAKER 2, SPEAKER 3, and SPEAKER 4 into the\nMaster column:\n345\n248 244\nTranslation 255\nPre-building the Speaker List with your generic designations accomplishes\nseveral things:\nÂ· Each time you translate notes or do a realtime job , the Speaker list will\nappear before the translation begins. You will have an opportunity to enter the\nspecific speaker names for this job.\nÂ· Master and Current columns make it easy to see which current speaker name\nis tied to which master (generic) speaker ID.\nÂ· Adding generic speaker IDs to a list via the Speaker List button on the\nTranslate tab ensures that each generic speaker ID will always occupy the\nsame slot in the list, and will always have the same shortcut key. In the above\ngraphic, F2 followed by 1 will always insert Speaker 1, F2 followed by 2 will\nalways insert Speaker 2, etc.\nÂ· You can pre-assign other features of the Speaker Data Dialog , such as\nshortcut keys, colors, and groups.\nUsing the Speaker List in Conjunction With Job Dictionaries\nIf you use generic speaker designations, and you use the Speaker List to assign\nCurrent names before translation begins, you will also have the option to add these\nnames to the Job dictionary.\n269 483\n248\n259\n256 Eclipse Help\nIf Save in is checked, Eclipse will automatically create Job dictionary entries to\nreflect any changes you make to the Speaker List. For example, if you have STPHAO =\n{S:SPEAKER 1} in your Main dictionary, and you assign the Master speaker \"SPEAKER\n1\" to \"MR. SMITH\" in the Speaker List, the entry STPHAO = {S:MR. SMITH} will be\ncreated in your Job dictionary. If you re-use this Job dictionary in the future, the\nCurrent speaker IDs will already be in place. Tools/Apply globals will apply these\nentries to the speaker table and the document.\nLoading From dictionaries\nThe Job dict/Load from checkbox is used when you already have a speaker\ndefinition in your job dictionary that creates a standard designation replacement for\nyour main dictionary. For example, take the following entries:\nMain dictionary: STPHAO = {S:SPEAKER1}\nJob dictionary: STPHAO = {S:MR. JONES}\nIf you have these entries prepared BEFORE you start translation, then the\ntranslator will automatically create a SPEAKER1=MR. JONES replacement, requiring\nno further work on your part. Using the dictionary entry method works hand-in-hand\nwith the speaker list method. For example, if you had a table with SPEAKER1, 2 and 3\non it and had the dictionary entries listed above, then when you started translation,\nthe speaker list dialog would appear as follows:\nMR. JONES SPEAKER1\nSPEAKER2\nSPEAKER3\nThe dialog box would open with the cursor in the edit box, and whatever you\ntype would be entered in SPEAKER2 when you hit enter, and the cursor returns to the\nedit box allowing you to type in the next speaker name. It already knows what\nSPEAKER1 should be.\nIf you leave part of the speaker list blank when translating, it will be ignored. It\nwill not make SPEAKER1=(nothing) as part of the translation rules. Escaping from the\nspeaker list will ignore it entirely. It will not add a blank entry as the first item in the\nF2 speaker box.\nYou can fill data into the speaker list in advance of a translation, and the speaker\nlist will then load the SPEAKER1=MR. SMITH text replacements into the job dictionary\nbeing used in translation so that that job dictionary can be used in future translations\nwithout having to re-enter the speaker replacements.\nAfter typing in the last speaker name, hitting the escape key will exit the\nspeaker list.\nJob dict/Load from is turned on (checked) by default. If you do not want to\nuse automatic text replacement for speakers, uncheck the box to turn this feature off.\nTranslation 257\nFor example, if you have SKWRAO = {S:SPEAKER 2} in the Main dictionary,\nSKWRAO = {S:MR. ANDERSON} in the Job dictionary, and SPEAKER 2 as a Master\nspeaker in the Speaker Table, Eclipse will automatically assign MR. ANDERSON to the\nCurrent speaker slot.\nSee Working With Multiple Dictionaries for more information about Job\ndictionaries.\nChanging Dictionaries\nThe speaker list will change on the fly when you change the dictionaries\ncurrently loaded, turn certain dictionaries on or off, or add or remove dictionaries from\nthe list of dictionaries in the job during realtime, that change is reflected in the\nspeaker list.\nFor example, if you have SPEAKER1 = MR. JONES in your job dictionary and you\nswitch to a different dictionary that contains SPEAKER1 = MR. SMITH, then not only\nwill it affect translation, but when you hit F2 to view the speaker list you will see that\nSPEAKER1 is now assigned as MR. SMITH.\nOther Actions\nThe Insert button will add a new speaker to the list. Enter the desired\ninformation into the Speaker Data Dialog . You can also add a new speaker to the\nlist by simply typing the speaker's name. The new speaker will be automatically\nassigned to the slot in the list that does not have a Current speaker name assigned.\n(NOTE: This may result in the speaker being assigned to a slot that has a Master\nspeaker name. To assign the new speaker to a specific location, use the Change\nbutton.\nDelete will delete the selected speaker from the list.\nChange will change an existing speaker. Select the speaker you want to edit,\nand make your desired changes in the Speaker Data Dialog .\nMove Up and Move Down will re-order the speakers. Click the speaker you\nwant to reposition, and click Move Up or Move Down. This will not change the\nshortcut key you press to insert them; it will only change the order of the list.\nThe leftmost column of the Speaker List is the shortcut key. This is the key you\npress, after pressing F2, to insert this speaker. Speaker shortcut keys can be\nreassigned in the Speaker Data Dialog . Select the speaker you want to assign a\nnew shortcut to, and then click Change.\nThe rightmost column of the Speaker List is the speaker Group. This can also be\nassigned in the Speaker Data Dialog .\nAdding or Deleting a Speaker\nTo manually add a speaker to the list, click Add, and type the name of the\nspeaker. Keep in mind that this speakername will have no underlying steno; the only\nway to insert it into a transcript will be via F2.\n675\n259\n259\n260\n260\n258 Eclipse Help\nShould you want to delete a speaker from the speaker list, select the desired\nspeaker and then click Delete. However, it is not necessary to do this. Unused\nspeaker IDs can simply remain in the list to no ill effect.\nAdding a Speaker during Shared Editing\nDuring a Shared (Team) Editing session, any change to the document data takes\nthe current user's document data and replaces everyone's with a complete copy. So, if\ntwo Team Editors modify the speaker table at the same time, the changes will cross\nover and only the last change will be applied. Eclipse will merge the data instead, but\nonly for speaker slots that would otherwise be empty.\nFor example, if two people simultaneously try to add a speaker 5, then only the\nlast user to add it will succeed. If one person tries to add speaker 5, and another user\nsimultaneously adds speaker 6, then the software will be able to add both to all team\nmembers' tables, since in each case, no matter which one shows up first, the other\nwill simply be taking the place of an empty slot.\nIf you frequently have multiple editors attempting to add the same speaker\nname at the same time, you can avoid problems by suggesting to each editor to use\ndifferent pre-arranged speaker numbers for creating new speaker names.\nUsing the Speaker List with the Find function\nYou can search for a speaker belonging to a particular group by using the find\nfunction. Select Paragraph: and Speaker, and instead of typing the speaker name as\nthe search text, type the group number. The system will then find the next speaker\nname belonging to that group.\nTranslation 259\nWhile editing, you can use the Find function and hit F2 to pick a name from the\nspeaker list. After selecting the speaker name, hit Enter to automatically select the\nParagraph option and the speaker paragraph type.\nVISUALIZERS:\nE4 - Speaker Globals\nE4 - Speakers\nE4a - Speaker Changes\nE4a - Speaker Corrections\nE4aa - Speaker Prep\nE4a - Tracking Speakers - The Seating Chart\n12.3.1.1 Speaker Data Dialog\nSpeaker Data Dialog\nRELATES TO: Speaker List .\nThe Speaker Data dialog appears whenever you click the Change button\nin the Speaker List .\n249\n249\n260 Eclipse Help\nThe Current text box is the name of this speaker for this transcript.

If you are changing a speaker name for the\ncurrent job only, change it in the Current box.\nThe Shortcut text box is the shortcut key for this speaker. After\npressing F2, press this key (or keys) to insert this speaker into the\ntranscript . You may use letters, numbers, and punctuation marks to\ncreate a shortcut. Shortcuts may also be more than one character; for\nexample, you could number your speakers from 10 to 99, A to Z, or use\nshorthand (e.g., BR for Mr. Brown). In the above graphic, the Shortcut key is\n2. Pressing paragraph speed key F2 followed by 2 would insert this\nspeaker.\nThe Color button allows you to assign a display color to this speaker.\nClicking this button will open the color dialog , where you can select the\ndesired color. The color you choose will apply to only this speaker, and will\naffect the display only (the speaker name will not print in this color).\nThe Group button allows you to assign this speaker to a group. For\nexample, you could create a group of plaintiff's attorneys, a group of\ndefendant's attorneys, and a group of deponents. You can enter names for\nthe group numbers in the table. For example, you could change the group\nnumber to 1 and enter \"Plaintiff's\" in the group name, then change it to 2\nand enter \"Defendant's.\" The groups are a global setting that gets stored in\nyour user.ini, not in the document. You can hace as many different speaker\ngroup names as you like, and you can configure the group names and\nstandard speakers under User settings/Translate/Speakers. The speaker\ntable will show the group name in the speaker table Group column.\n253\n254\n252\n349\n122\nTranslation 261\nThe Group name can also be used in searches. In the Find dialog, select\nParagraphs and Speaker, and instead of typing the speaker name as the\nsearch text, type the group number. The system will then find the next\nspeaker name belonging to that group.\n12.3.1.2 Seating Chart\nSpeaker Seating Chart\nRELATES TO: The Speaker List ,\nOn the Speaker List, there is a Seating chart checkbox.\nIf you check it, a Seating chart dialog will appear.\n249\n262 Eclipse Help\nClicking in the box again will uncheck it, and cause the Seating chart to\ndisappear.\nThe seating chart dialog can be moved, resized, anchored, zoomed (to\nmake the fonts bigger or smaller) and made more transparent (see graphic\nfor an example of 30% transparency.)\nThough it will remember its location if anchored, because it would tend\nto get in the way of everything other than writing realtime, you will have to\nopen it each session if you wish to use it (which can be done conveniently\nfrom the speaker dialog that appears at the beginning of a translation for you\nto fill in speaker names.)\nTranslation 263\nThe seating chart dialog will contain blocks for each speaker in the list in\nwhich the \"Current\" speaker name is not blank. When you first open the\nSeating chart, the names are in cascading formation. The blocks can be\nrearranged by clicking and dragging them with the left mouse button.\nEach individual job remembers the speaker's locations, though they do\nNOT remember the size/zoom/location of the chart dialog individually. The\nblocks will contain the current speaker name, the shortcut number/letter,\nand the master speaker name.\nThe positions of the speakers are stored permanently, so if, for\nexample, you've put speaker number 1 and speaker number 2 in particular\npositions, they'll stay there for the next job, even if the speakers 1 and 2 are\ndifferent names.\nIf you are using Multi-channel recording , the Seating chart will show\nthe locations of each microphone, and once they are associated with the\ncorrect speaker, Eclipse will use that information to play back the appropriate\naudio.\nIf you wish to be reminded of the steno used to write these speaker\nnames, it is necessary to use master speaker names that contain the steno\nas part of the text of the entry.\nFor example, if you use STPHAO and SKWRAO for speakers 1 and 2,\nthen instead of naming the master speakers {S:SPEAKER01} and\n{S:SPEAKER02}, name them {S:MR. STPHAO} and {S:MR. SKWRAO} or\n{S:STPHAO} and {S:SKWRAO} or something like that. Because main and\njob dictionaries will often have several entries for the same speaker name,\nsuch as STPHAO = {S:SPEAKER01} and STKPHAO = {S:SPEAKER01},\nEclipse cannot name them automotically.\nThe colors of the blocks on the seating chart will be determined by using\nthe colors indicated in the speaker table. Select a speaker and hit Change to\nchange the color for that speaker number. The text of the speaker name itself\nwill be black or white depending on which one shows up better on the\nparticular background color you have selected.\nYou can also turn the Seating chart on and off using the Window\nmenu/View toggles (Ctrl+Shift+F3).\n12.3.1.3 Searching for a Speaker with the Find function\nSearching for a Speaker with the Find function\nYou can search for a speaker belonging to a particular group by using the find\nfunction.\n659\n116\n264 Eclipse Help\nSelect Appearing ...

After selecting the speaker name, hit OK to automatically select the\nParagraph option and the speaker paragraph type.\n12.4 Setting Number Formats\nSetting Number Formats: the\nNumbers Tab\nRELATES TO: Working With Number\nConversion , User Settings .\nThe User settings/Numbers tab allows you to set general preferences for the\nappearance and formatting of numbers. For a fuller description of how number\nconversion works, see Working With Number Conversion .\nOnce you have entered your preferences for number handling, you can stroke\nnumbers the way you hear them and Eclipse will apply the appropriate rules. These\noptions let you avoid many cumbersome dictionary entries. To make use of the\nnumber conversion options, make sure that the Number conversion checkbox is\nmarked.\nWhen converting a number during editing, Eclipse will recognize the value and\nnumber type of the highlighted number. For example, if you mark \"$30\" and hit the\nnumber conversion command, it will recognize it as the value \"30\" and that it is a\ndollar amount. Note that this only applies to quantities, currency and ordinal\nnumbers. There is no automation of this sort for template patterns.\n684 99\n684\nTranslation 265\nGeneral Options\nThe Number Conversion checkbox enables number conversion. If unchecked,\nEclipse will not convert your numbers.\nThe Vocabulary setup button opens the Number vocabulary dialog , which is\ncovered in detail in the Reference Guide .\nThe Auto-redact button opens a list of number types, where you can select\nwhich number types will automatically be inserted as redacted text. Social security\nnumbers, phone numbers, and bank account numbers are all examples of numbers\nyou might want to automatically be redacted.\nIf Ignore written numbers is checked, any numbers that are defined as words\nwill not be affected by number conversion. Use this feature only if you are very strict\nabout writing words when you want written-out numbers, and using the number bar\nwhen you want digits. (Note: if you do this, set everything in Numeric Classes to\n\"No Values.\") With Ignore written numbers turned off, writing â5 hundred secondâ will\nresult in 502nd. However, writing â4 point three milesâ will translate 4.3 miles.\nIf you use strokes for Arabic numerals different from those you use for written\nnumbers (â1â vs. âoneâ), then mark the Ignore written numbers checkbox. By doing\nso, you will keep Eclipse from converting your written numbers to numerals and\napplying the automatic number conversion rules. However, if you use the same stroke\nfor an Arabic numeral and its written counterpart, leave this checkbox blank.\n821\n699\n268\n266 Eclipse Help\nProcess \"and\" as a number should be checked if you tend to write the word\n\"and\" in phrases like \"three hundred and fifty\". In the Number vocabulary dialog,\nthe Grouping word refers to the word used to join the numbers in a âcompoundâ\nnumber. By letting Eclipse know what word is used to combine numbers, you can\ncontrol how such numbers are translated. For example, âone hundred and forty eightâ\ncan be translated as â148â rather than â100 and 48.â If you donât want to have\nnumbers combined in this fashion, uncheck the Process âandâ as a number\ncheckbox.\nForce measurements to digits forces all numbers that precede a unit-ofmeasure\nword to appear as digits. When off, singular measurements will still\nhyphenate, but will appear as phrases like âa three-mile walk.â\nForce separators in currency handles currency values of exactly four digits a\nbit differently from the way they would normally be handled. If you turn this option\noff, then currency will only have commas in it if you write more than four digits, or if\nyou write a {#Q} trigger during the number, or if you use the word \"thousand\" to\nindicate an order of magnitude. All other ways of writing four-digit currency will omit\nthe comma.\nExamples of what happens when you turn off Force separators in currency:\nÂ· 12345 dollars = $12,345\nÂ· 1234 dollars = $1234\nÂ· 12 hundred dollars = $1200\nÂ· 1 thousand 2 hundred dollars = $1,200\nMinimum quantity size controls the appearance of commas in four-digit\nnumbers. Set this to 0 if you want a comma every three digits. If you don't want fourdigit\nnumbers to have a comma, set this to 4. To set this preference, type the highest\nnumber of digits that you want represented without a delimiter.\nExtra ordinal formatting will superscript the text part of a numeric ordinal,\nlike this: 3rd. If unchecked, it will appear as 3rd. It will also force the system into\nâliteral caseâ mode so the ordinal suffix will appear in lower case even if you have all\ncaps output selected.\nIf Glue numbers is checked, all numbers will also behave as glue characters .\nThis is useful for writing alphanumeric combinations, such as license plate numbers.\nTime allows you to specify a format for whole-hour times. Select the desired\nappearance from the Time drop-down list.\nThe ___ Digits = ________ items in the center left of the Numbers tab\ncontrol the default appearance of numbers. If you write a series of digits, without any\ncontext words (like a.m. or dollars) or conversion codes present, Eclipse will use\nthese choices to format the number. In other words, if you set Digits to 9, you will see\nthat the default arrangement is a U.S. Social Security Number. Seven- and ten-digit\nnumbers default to being North American phone numbers. You can re-assign these if\nyou like, but if you find you are getting unexpected results (for instance, you write a\n4-digit number expecting 2008 and get 2,008) you may want to set these back to the\ndefaults and see if that corrects your problem. The default settings are:\n821\n960\n685\nTranslation 267\nÂ· 1-3 : Quantity\nÂ· 4-6, 8, 11-19: Generic\nÂ· 7 and 10 digits: Phone\nÂ· 9 digits: Soc. Sec.\nRemember, the ___ Digits = ______ settings take effect when you write a\nnumber that does NOT include context words (triggers) that imply a number\nconversion. In other words, if you write \"five billion 6 dollars 4 cents,\" there are\nactually two trigger words in that string: dollars and cents both trigger a money\nconversion. If you write \"five billion 25 thousand thirty-two,\" the billion and the\nthousand are both triggers for a quantity number conversion.\nQuantity numbers involve commas. Generic numbers are just a pure string of\ndigits without any commas. When you write \"nineteen ninety-seven,\" you should get\nthe generic number 1997. That makes sense because there are no trigger words to\ncall for any other conversion. If you write \"four twenty-two 96 eighty-three forty-five,\"\nyou should get 422-96-8345 because it's a nine-digit number and, by default, this\nwould call for a Social Security number conversion.\nMeasurements will translate with a hyphen between the numbers, the entry is a\nplural measurement. So an entry such as 7/mile/{^s} produces \"7 miles\" instead of\n\"7-miles\". The measurement translator looks ahead for the next entry and if it\nspecifically contains {^s} it will treat it as a plural measurement instead of a singular\none, even before the next entry officially translates.\nThe predefined number formats are described below.\nQuantity - Treats the string of digits as a quantity.\nMoney - Uses the currency format you set in the Number vocabulary dialog\n(accessed from the Vocabulary setup button).\nOrdinal - 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.\nRoman - Roman numerals. Note that if there are more than four digits, a Roman\nnumeral trigger cannot be calculated, and it will leave the digits, such as 43682.\nGeneric - Arabic numerals (âfour five sixâ = 456) displays numbers without\ncommas.\nPhone - Places a hyphen after the first three digits in a string of seven digits. In\na string of ten digits, encloses the first three digits in parentheses and places a\nhyphen after the sixth, as in (###)###-####.\nSocial Security - Places a hyphen after the third and fifth digits in a nine-digit\nnumber.\nTime - Places a colon after the second digit in a string of four digits, or after the\nfirst digit in a string of three digits.\nZip Code - Places a hyphen after the first five digits in a nine-digit string.\nDate - The default format for date places a slash after the appropriate digits in a\nthree- to eight-digit number. This format handles dates as follows:\n(1 digit)0 = '0\n268 Eclipse Help\n(2 digits) 00 = '00\n(3 digits) 000 = 0/00\n(4 digits) 0000 = 0/0/00\n(5 digits) 00000 = 0/00/00 or 00/0/00\n(6 digits) 000000 = 00/00/00\n(7 digits) 0000000 = 0/00/0000 or 00/0/0000\n(8 digits) 00000000 = 00/00/0000\nTo change the date format, edit the template labeled â0â in the âTemplatesâ\narea. For example, to use hyphens in place of slashes, type the format â##-##-##.â\nNumeric Classes\nThe Numeric classes area at bottom left controls the default appearance of\nyour numbers. Use this area to control which numbers are written out, and which are\nrendered as digits.\nThere are three categories: Quantity, Currency, and Ordinal. You can select\nWrite Out, At Start, and Clarify for each category. This allows you to define different\nrules for currency amounts and quantities, for example.\nWrite Out controls the appearance of a number, such as numbers one through\nnine (1â9), 1-12, 1-10 and even 10âs or 1-100 and even 100âs. The numbers that you\nselect will always be written out. For example, if you select \"1-10\", the numbers one\nthrough ten will appear as text, but 11 and higher will appear as digits. If you want\nall numbers from one to ten to be written out, and also all multiples of ten to ninety\n(twenty, thirty, ... ninety), select, â1-10, 20, 30 â¦â from the drop-down menu. In\naddition to the items on the drop-down menu, you can edit the description directly to\naccommodate your own set of rules.\nAt Start controls the appearance of a number at the beginning of a sentence.\nSelect the desired range of numbers that are to be written out when they begin a\nsentence. For example, to have all numbers written out at the start of sentences,\nselect All values from the drop-down menu.\nClarify controls the point at which a very large number is rendered in words\ninstead of numbers. For example, if this is set to Million, you will get \"35 million\"\ninstead of \"35,000,000.\" When Clarify is set at âmillion+,â Eclipse translates eleven\nthousand as â11,000,â and if itâs set to thousand+ it will translate eleven thousand as\nâ11 thousand.â If set to none, the clarification is disabled, and numbers of high\nmagnitude appear as 000,000,000,000,000,000 etc.\nNumber Templates and Number Vocabulary\nThese are advanced features, and are covered in the Reference Guide .\nCustom codes\n819 821\n699\nTranslation 269\nThe bottom right corner of the Numbers tab allows you to create your own\nnumber conversion codes .\nVisualizers:\nvG1_Numbers_Overview.mp4\nvG1a_Number_Settings.mp4\nvM12_Auto-Magic_Numbers.mp4\n12.5 Translate Notes dialog\nTranslate Notes\nAlt+T\nProduction/Translate..\nRELATES TO: Realtime , Note Files ,\nAudio recording\nThe Translate notes dialog allows you to translate an existing note file , or\ninitiate a realtime job.\n685\n483 224\n649\n224\n483\n270 Eclipse Help\nBefore you begin translating notes you should set the dictionaries that you want\nto use; for example, do you want to use the job dictionary, or any user dictionaries?\nThere also are many options you can set to tell Eclipse how to translate specific things\nand how to handle translation problems (conflicts and untranslates). Setting these\noptions can make the translation and editing process faster and more efficient.\nYou can set many of these options in your User Settings (Alt+U), which you\ncan also access by clicking the User settings button ( ) in the Translate notes\ndialog. These settings are saved and used, by default, whenever you translate in\nEclipse, until you change them. In other words, you need to set them only once.\nThe dictionaries can be changed in the Translate notes dialog , overriding the\nUser Settings for just that job. If, however, you change the Main dictionary in the\nTranslate notes dialog, you will make that same main dictionary change in User\nSettings.\n275\nTranslation 271\nTo create settings for translations, go to User settings (Alt+U)/Translate .\nTranslating a Note File\n1. Open the Translate notes dialog (Alt+T).\n2. Click the Notes.. button. Select the desired note file from the file dialog\n.\n3. If you want to change the name for the transcript file, click the Text.. button\nand type the new name.\n4. Under Translation modes, select either Tran and edit or Quick tran.\n5. Confirm that the dictionaries you wish to use for this job have been selected.\nIf you want to make a change, click the Dictionaries button. This will take\nyou to the dictionaries dialog .\n6. Make your desired choices including use Boost , Share document with\nConnection Magic , and Initial block, and Final block.\n7. Click OK to begin the translation.\nDoing a Realtime Job\n1. On the Input Tab of User Settings , select your writer, baud rate, \"Realtime\nfrom\", and COM port (if you are connecting via COM port). (Your existing\nsettings, as well as any Output Formats you may have set up, will be listed\nbelow the Translation modes area in the Translate notes dialog. If you\nneed to change any of these, clicking the User settings icon - the gears - will\nopen the Translate tab of User settings, where you can make the changes).\n2. Click the Text button.

Click OK to begin the translation.\nIt is possible for note file and the text file to have different names. To do\nthis, first select the note file. Eclipse will, by default, assign the same name to the\ntext file. Then, click the Text button, and change the default name to something else.\nThis is useful if you are retranslating a note file, but do not wish to overwrite the\nexisting text file.\nOptions on the Translate Notes dialog\nÂ· Under Translate modes, choose one of the following:\n244\n224 969\n955\n285\n532\n226\n947\n520\n244\n969\n955\n649 285\n532\n224 694\n272 Eclipse Help\nÂ· Tran and edit: Translates an existing note file and allows you to edit the text\nfile (translation) while it is still being translated. When editing while\ntranslating, the text document opens when the translation begins, and you can\nimmediately begin editing it. Note that although Tran and edit mode is\nconvenient, it will slow the translation process.\nÂ· Quick tran: Translates an existing note file when you donât want or need to\nedit during translation. Does not allow you to see the text file until it is\ncomplete, but translation goes faster. A progress bar will appear to inform\nyou of the progress of the translation\nÂ· Realtime: Begins a realtime job.\nÂ· Virtual realtime: Translates an existing note file, but it behaves like a\nrealtime job. Specifically, any realtime output options you have in place will\nbe utilized. For example, this would allow you to test your CIC or\ncaptioning output without having a writer handy. You would select Virtual\nrealtime, pick an existing note file, and see if the output works. Virtual\nrealtime is a diagnostic tool, and not a way to produce a new transcript. When\nyou start, it opens a control panel that allows you to step through a\ntranslation, by using a Stop button, a Pause button, and a Next stroke button.\nYou can step through a translation one stroke at a time by pressing the Next\nstroke button, or you can let it roll by unpausing it. You can pause it at any\ntime if you want to go back to viewing the translation one stroke at a time,\nand you can use the Stop button at any time to stop the translation\naltogether.\nÂ· Record audio: Check this box to record and synchronize audio during a\nrealtime translation. (This option is not available unless the Realtime\ntranslation mode checkbox is marked.) See the page on working with audio\nfor further discussion. Applies to Realtime jobs only.\nYou can right-click in the Realtime status window, and use the Configuration\nmenu to customize how it looks. Each item in the window can be selected or\ndeselected by clicking on the appropriate checkbox. The window will resize to fit the\nremaining indicators. You can also choose to arrange the items vertically (the default)\nor horizontally.\n694\n1040\n483\n519\n519\n666\n649\nTranslation 273\nIn addition to the untranslates count, there is a Unique untranslates count\ntelling you how many different untranslates you have written in the current file, rather\nthan the total number. For example, if you write TKAEUF, TKAEUF, PWEPB, PWEPB,\nTPHRO, that would count as 5 untranslates, but only 3 unique untranslates. A total\nand percentage are supplied. Uncheck the box in the Configuration menu if you do not\nwant to use the Unique count.\nÂ· Phonetic untranslates: If checked, any untranslated steno will appear in its\nphonetic form. (In User Settings/Translate you can set the Phonetic typeâ\nBasic or Intelligent.) If unchecked, the raw steno will appear. It is advisable to\ncheck this if you are doing captioning or any kind of realtime output\n(since most viewers will not be able to read steno, but will get the gist from\nthe phonetics).\nAn example of a phonetic equivalent is âmanâ for the steno PHAPB. In the\nPhonetic type field, select Basic or Intelligent phonetics. Basic phonetics would\ntranslate PHAEUBG as âmayk.â When intelligent phonetics is selected, Eclipse uses the\nphonetics and the spelling dictionary to guess the correct translation. Using intelligent\nphonetics would translate PHAEUBG as âmake.â\nBasic and intelligent phonetics use the Phonetics table found on the User\nsettings/Programming tab to display untranslates. You can modify your Phonetics\ntable to match your steno theory. See the Phonetics Table help page for details.\nAlso, see the Visualizer (C1 - below) on Phonetics Table Customization.\nÂ· Enable output: If you have made any selections in Output Formats ,\nEclipse will send the realtime job to those recipients. Applies to Realtime and\nVirtual Realtime jobs only. It determines whether or not to use the output\nformats, so with this checkbox you can disable the output formats for this\nparticular translation without having to change your User settings.\n666 519\n826\n858\n520\n274 Eclipse Help\nNote that if Enable output is turned off, you can start realtime without\nestablishing any connection whatsoever to the output system. Then, when you're\nready to start, use the Tools/Edit toggles/RT Output ON option (or the suspend\ntoggle macro) and at that point, the system will start the initialization process for the\noutput system. This sequence of operations allows you to start realtime in order to do\ndictionary prep and practice ahead of time and only start the output when you're\nready, without having to restart the realtime entirely.\nÂ· Prompt for starting stroke: If you turn this off, it will always start from the\nlast stroke in the writer. Note that this option is permanently stored and will\nthen apply to the use of the \"Instant realtime\" button, as well.\nÂ· Share document with Connection Magic - with this turned on, when you\nstart a translation, the Session settings dialog will open, and you can enter a\npassword and choose to make it publicly visible or not for a scopist. If you\ncheck this box, it will stay checked until you change it.\n532\nTranslation 275\nÂ· Initial block and Final block: If you have block files that you want\ninserted at the beginning and/or end of your transcript, you can have them\nincluded during translation. Mark the Initial block or Final block checkbox, as\nrelevant. To indicate which file to use for the initial or final block, click the\nrelevant button. You will then get a file dialog from which you can specify the\nEclipse text file. The current block file selections are listed to the right of the\nInitial block and Final block buttons. Initial block files will be sent along with\nyour document to your output system, such as LiveNote, CaseView or Bridge.\nSee Visualizer\nÂ· The Dictionaries button will open the dictionaries dialog , from which\nadditional dictionaries can be selected for use in translation.\nÂ· The gear button will take you to the Realtime Tab of User Settings .\nIf you want the Realtime Status Window to appear, showing the number of\nentries, untranslates, conflicts , unresolved conflicts, and words per minute, open\nthe View toggles, and check the Realtime statistics box.

Clicking the Dictionaries button opens\nthe Dictionaries dialog.\n548\n275\n955\n487\n492\n169\n1164\n276 Eclipse Help\nThe name of your main dictionary is listed in the Main field. To select a\ndifferent main dictionary, highlight the name and click the Change button.\nA file dialog opens allowing you to select a different main dictionary.\nThe display area also lists any additional dictionaries that were specified\nin your user settings.\nTo remove a dictionary from this list, select it (click once on it) and\nthen click Remove. The Remove button removes a dictionary from this list; it\ndoes not delete the actual dictionary.\nTo add a dictionary, click Add. A file dialog window appears, from which\nyou can browse and select one or more dictionaries. You can use Shift+click\nor Ctrl+click to select multiple dictionaries to use in a translation.\nJob Dictionary\nBy default, a job dictionary (eg., newjob.dix) appears below the Main\ndictionary on this list. If you have specified a Job dictionary in User\nSettings/User/Dictionaries/Job, that dictionary will appear here. If not, a\ndictionary is created at the time of translation, which contains no entries, but\ncan be used during editing to store job-specific entries (participantsâ names,\ncase-specific terminology, etc.).\nThen, when editing, whenever you make a global and hit Ctrl+J, it will\nplace the entry into the job dictionary featured in the dictionary list that is\naccessible when you hit the âOpen dictionaryâ function from within a job.\nThat means if you select a job dictionary for a job, that dictionary will then be\nconsidered the job dictionary for that job for all future functions, EVEN IF\n(and this is key) EVEN IF you change the job dictionary in the user settings\nat a future date.\nTranslation 277\nSo jobs remember what job dictionary they are associated with, even if\nit's not the dictionary with the same name as the job.\nWhen opening a job dictionary, Eclipse looks for the .dix file in the\nfollowing locations, in this order:\n1. The same folder as the .ecl file.\n2. The current folder.\n3. The current jobs folder.\nJob dictionaries are also used to convey conflict resolution information\nfrom the reporter to the scopist. Scopists should keep job-specific items in\nthe Job dictionary, which will help the reporter have a cleaner main\ndictionary.\nEdit Dictionary\nThe Edit Dictionary exists on an Edit Station, and is a repository for\nglobals. Any âMainâ globals performed by the scopist will go into this\ndictionary; and if the reporter and scopist are communicating via Eclipse\nsteno-link, the globals will go to the Reporter's computer for inclusion in their\ndictionary.\nBy default the Edit Dictionary will have the same name as the Eclipse\nuser you created it under, e.g. FRED.DIX, SALLY.DIX, etc.\nTo integrate the entire Edit dictionary into your main dictionary, you\nneed to do the following:\n1. Open the Main dictionary.\n2. Press Alt+R.\n3. Select the Edit dictionary.\nTo integrate only selected items from the Edit dictionary into the main\ndictionary, you can open the Edit dictionary, and delete the unwanted entries\nbefore merging via Alt+R.\nNOTE: If you are concerned about overwriting an existing entry, you\ncan turn on the Detect Conflicts in User Settings/Edit. With this item on, you\nwill be prompted before any entry is overwritten.\nBenefiting from the Scopist's conflict selections\nEclipse has an artificial intelligence feature whereby the program will\nâlearnâ from the conflict choices made during editing, and use this\ninformation to resolve conflicts automatically. In a reporter-scopist situation,\nthe reporter needs to follow a series of steps to benefit from the scopistâs\nchoices:\n278 Eclipse Help\n1. When translating the job, Make edit station info needs to be\nchecked in the User settings/Translate tab. When this option is\nmarked, Eclipse inserts additional information into the job dictionary\nthat allows scopists to reselect conflicts. This will allow your conflict\ndictionary entries to benefit from the scopist's conflict selections.\n2. When you give the job to the scopist for editing, you must include\nthe dictionary which has the same name as the job (even if the job\ndictionary has a different name).\n3. When the scopist selects the conflicts, the conflict selection\ninformation will go into the Edit dictionary. This is indicated with the\ntext (AI:1) which will appear after any conflict for which the scopist\nhas made a selection.\n4. When you get the Edit Dictionary back, you can transfer that entry\ninto your main dictionary using Block/Read.\nThe job dictionary is used to convey conflict information from the\nreporter to the scopist; the Edit dictionary is used to convey it back.\nFurthermore, the job dictionary is used by both reporter and scopist for jobspecific\ndictionary entries.\n12.6 Virtual untranslates\nVirtual untranslates\nYou can use virtual untranslates such as {U:CHECK SPELLING} to\nindicate a problem, which allows you to scan to a trouble spot and identify\nwhy you marked it. It acts like an untranslate, but it doesn't count against\nyou as an untranslate in your untran percentage in the realtime status dialog.\n12.7 Translation Magic\nTranslation Magic\nRELATES TO: Translate Tab ,\nTranslation Magic allows you to write long words that you do not have defined in\nyour dictionary.\n1. Just write words phonetically and they'll translate correctly.\n244\nTranslation 279\nTranslation magic is turned on by opening the User settings/Translate tab,\nclicking on the Translation Magic button, and putting a check in the Translation\nmagic checkbox. Other settings in the Translation Magic settings dialog control\nexactly the results you will get.\nWhen you write a long word phonetically it will translate correctly. For example,\nwhen you write a long word like \"lipofibroma\" which is not in your dictionary,\nTranslation magic will apply Intelligent phonetics to the multiple steno strokes and\ntranslate the word correctly. It can be used in either Realtime or deferred translations.\n2. You can make a lot more mistakes and still get the right translation.\nTranslation Magic is not limited to one-stroke words. Using Translation magic will\neven give you reliable translations for multi-stroke words containing misstrokes.\nWithout Translation magic turned on, Fix misstrokes during translation is limited\nto one-stroke words, and can only contain one error. Translation Magic will apply\nDragged and Dropped keys to multiple steno strokes and allows as many errors as you\nare capable of making as long as the word is still even marginally recognizable.\nMulti-stroke words containing misstrokes will often translate reliably. So, the\nsoftware is able to figure out that when you wrote TPKAOE/SEPBLS/TKAOEUZ/AEUGSZ\nyou were trying to write \"desensitization\" even with the extra P, L K and Z.\nWhen Translation Magic finds an alternate translation, it will put that translation\nin untranslate color so you can scan to it and find it easily.\nIf Translation Magic recognizes a series of misstrokes as a dictionary entry\ncontaining multiple words, it will allow those words to translate individually.\n280 Eclipse Help\nDragged/Dropped keys\nIf you select an option from Translation Magic that is a misstroke, the system\nwill look at the stroke(s) you wrote, compare them against the stroke(s) for the\nreplacement you just selected, and know with certainty that you dragged or dropped\nthe keys representing the differences between the two strokes.\nEclipse stores that data permanently in your user.ini file. You can view this data\nby going to User settings/Translate - The History button is at the bottom of the\nTranslation Magic settings dialog (see below).\nThe visualization shows how many times each key was dragged or dropped, and\nuses a red bar to show, proportionally, how much that key was dragged compared to\nall other keys, and a green bar to show, proportionally, how much that key was\ndropped to compared to other keys.\nWith a bit more information, this feature should be able to suggest which keys\nshould be made more or less sensitive, regardless of what writer you use. For Passport\nusers, it could be extended to make the modifications for you directly to the writer's\nsettings.\nWith any writer, however, this visualization can help. If a key has a large red\nbar, then you're dragging it a lot and the key should be made less sensitive. If it has\na large green bar, then you're dropping it a lot and the key should be made more\nsensitive.\nYou can right-click on any key to clear the statistics for that key, or right-click on\nthe heading at the top to clear all of them.\nTranslation 281\nTranslation Magic settings dialog\nWhen you click on the Translation Magic button in the User\nsettings/Translate tab, the Translation Magic settings dialog opens. The settings\nhere con be used to fine-tune how Translation Magic works for you.\nRequire an untran: If this box is checked, Eclipse will leave alone anything in\nyour dictionary and will only attempt to make a replacement if it see there is an\nuntran in the sequence of steno. If this is checked, Eclipse will ignore your attempt to\nwrite out a long word phonetically, and miss any word that is made up of English\nwords (eg. mytomycin, which can be broken down into my, toe, my, and sin). Leave it\nunchecked, and Eclipse will consider the frequency of use of a dictionary entry, and\nhow many strokes you used -- a longer entry is more likely something you meant to\nwrite and not a mistake. The Confidence Scores of entries are also taken into\naccount.\nUse only drag/drop: If this box is checked, Eclipse will look for misstrokes in\nthe dictionary based only on the dragged or dropped keys you specified under User\nsettings/Translation/Fix misstrokes/drag-drop keys. This is not generally\nrecommended, but some users prefer this method of controlling Translation Magic.\n235\n282 Eclipse Help\nOverall replacements: The Overall replacements slider can be set from 0 to\n100. Setting the weight to zero will ensure that it will only make a replacement where\nthere is an untranslate. Setting it to 100 will allow it to make a replacement almost\nanywhere. The ideal setting will vary depending on your workload and the maturity of\nyour dictionary. If you have a heavily developed dictionary, you will want to set it\nhigher to give Translation Magic permission to replace words that it would normally\nleave alone. If you write very cleanly, you will want to make it lower in order to\nprevent it from making unnecessary guesses in places where you have written\ncorrectly.\nMisstroke replacements and Phonetic replacements: The Misstroke\nreplacements slider determines how likely Translation Magic is to prefer misstrokes.\nThe Phonetic replacements slider determines how likely Translation Magic is to prefer\nphonetic replacements.\nYou can test your replacement settings by typing in sequences of steno strokes\nto see how they would translate with the current settings. Hit the Test steno button,\ntype a sequence of steno strokes, and watch what happens.\nThe box on the left will show the original steno strokes. The box on the right will\nshow a detailed report of how Translation Magic would process those strokes IF they\nwere the very next thing that was going to translate, so when testing for a particular\nsequence, always start with the first stroke in the sequence, though you can add extra\nstrokes to the end to test for matches that might be too long.\nThe results box shows the following information: First, it shows how the strokes\nwould translate from your main dictionary, which it will display in brackets.\nIt will then show how certain the translator is that these strokes should or\nshould not be considered for possible replacement by Translation Magic. Any inclusion\nof an untranslate will drop the certainty to zero. High-frequency words will usually be\n100%. Note that moving the \"Overall replacements\" slider can cause this percentage\nto change, permitting more or fewer opportunities for Translation Magic to change\nyour translation.\nFinally, it will show a list of the possible replacements that Translation Magic\nwould consider for that start of the steno sequence. These will be marked with (M) for\nmisstrokes and (P) for phonetics, and will have a priority number associated with\nthem. Misstrokes will also show the steno for the entry that it is considering using to\nreplace what was written.\nThe smaller the priority number, the more likely it is to be used (1st priority is\nbetter than 10th.) The top item is the one that would be translated. It may be that for\nsome replacements that are right on the borderline, changing the sliders will cause\nthe replacements to change or may cause it not to be replaced at all.\nThe decision about whether to use a misstroke or phonetic is often very easy,\nsince most steno sequences are not hugely ambiguous. However, this feature does\noffer some insight into where a Translation Magic result came from.\nTranslation 283\nSo, if you get an unusual Translation Magic replacement and are wondering\nwhere it came from, enter the steno into this dialog and you will find out. If it's a\nmisstroke, you will see the (M) and you will also see the steno for the entry, so you\ncould remove it from your main dictionary if you wish. If it's a phonetic replacement,\nyou'll see the (P) and know that you could remove it from the spelling dictionary if\nyou don't ever want the word to appear, or you could examine your phonetics table\nand make adjustments there. If you are getting suggestions that don't match you\nsteno theory, you may have entries in the phonetics table that ASI Support can help\nyou find and remove.\nIn order for phonetic translation to work, Eclipse will install the necessary\ndefault phonetics. If your phonetic translation is not working, you should import the\ndefault phonetics.\nThe phonetics table is organized like this:\nSTENO=pronunciation1,pronunciation2,pronunciation3|spelling1,spelling2,spelling3...\nFor example, -GS is -GS=gs,ings,tion,tial|sion,cial. Everything to the right of the\n| sign is an alternate spelling for one of the possible pronunciations.\nFor details on how the Phonetics Table works, see the Reference Guide .\nExceptions button and Phonetics button: These will directly open up the\neditor window for modifying those items, which are normally accessed in User\nsettings/Programming/Translation Magic Rules and User\nsettings/Programming/Phonetics table .\nShow as ... (dropdown list): You can choose how to display the text created by\nTranslation Magic. Select from the dropdown list of text types: Normal, Untranslate,\nConflict, Selected confilct, AI-selected conflict, etc., or one of the 8 User-defined text\ntypes.\nYou can choose to use the same text type for both Translation Magic and\nIntegral Prefix/suffix, though you may want to be able to differentiate which feature\nwas responsible for a particular translation. Here you have the option to set a different\ntext type for your TM translated text.\nBoost\nThis feature is new in version 10. Information on setup and use are here .\nTranslation Magic rules\nUnder User settings/Programming there is a setting for Translation Magic\nrules where you can adjust the way Translation Magic works. You can use the\nbutton labeled Exceptions to jump directly to this dialog.\nWith the right entries here, you can eliminate many \"false positives\": Places\nwhere Translation Magic makes a replacement where it should not have, or replaces\ntoo much steno when it found a long match that it liked.\nThe rules allow you to specifically eliminate false positives through several\nmechanisms.\nFirst, you can enter any single steno stroke on a line by itself in order to prohibit\nTranslation Magic from ever replacing that steno, no matter what.\n858\n858\n285\n883\n284 Eclipse Help\nThere are certain strokes that tend to get absorbed into Translation Magic that\nare often undesirable. For example, if you write the word \"agree\" followed by a period\n(-FPLT) you could end up with \"agreement\" if Translation Magic guesses that -FPLT is\na misstroke for -PLT. -RBGS can end up creating all sorts of interesting phonetic\nreplacements with \"rks\" in them. For that reason, putting -FPLT and -RBGS on this list\nis recommended.\nYou may want to add some other high-frequency strokes, such as A or E,\nbecause they can often cause phonetic false positives.\nSecond, you can eliminate certain entry text strings from consideration for\nmisstroke replacement. For example, you probably don't want an untran to be\ninterpreted as the {DELETE} stroke, or as an editing macro. You might also want to\nprohibit print commands.\nYou can totally customize what you want to prohibit. In the same list as you can\ntype the steno, you can also type lines starting with +, =, < or > to indicate the\nfollowing:\n=EntryEquals\n+EntryContains\n&EntryStartsWith\n>EntryEndsWith\nThe default entries are:\n={DELETE} - prevents Translation Magic from translating something as the\ndelete stroke\n<{M: - prevents it from translating any entry starting with {M:, which would be\nany macro\n+{FLUSH} - prevents it from translating any entry containing the flush\ncommand, which could be disruptive for captioners.\nCombined with the Translation Magic sensitivity settings, you may be able to\nturn the feature up to a more aggressive setting and eliminate the false positives a\nfew at a time using the exception rules.\nTranslation Magic \"On-Demand\"\nIf you are writing in Realtime or Captioning, and do not want to turn on\nTranslation Magic, you can use it on a case-by-case basis to create a dictionary entry\nfor long words you will be using repeatedly. Here are the steps to follow:\n1. Create a writer macro that uses the \"Add dictionary entry\" function and then\nenters \"#\" (the number bar) by itself as the steno stroke, which will be a\nsignal to the globaling window that the steno is in progress.\n2. The globaling window will then appear and you can begin writing the steno\nyou wish to use live. Each stroke you write will show up on the globaling\nwindow and will update the global magic choices numbered from 1-10.\nTranslation 285\n3. Once you finish writing the word, hit the number bar/digit combination you\nwish (1-9) or use a keyboard macro defined as the 1 through 9 key (either\none will work.)\n4. Once you select an item in this special mode, the dictionary entry will be\ncreated AND that entry will instantly translate into your file.\nFor example, if you define the above macro as \"TPO*\" for example (as in, \"I'm\nabout to write something phonetically\") then if you had to write \"he had arthroscopic\nsurgery\" but you knew for certain that you didn't have \"arthroscopic\" in your\ndictionary you could write\nE/HAD/TPO*/AR/THRO/SKOP/EUBG/1/SURG/RAOE\nThe result would be that the sentence would come out perfectly and you could\nwrite AR/THRO/SKOP/EUBG for the rest of the job to get \"arthroscopic\" because it\nwould also create the job dictionary entry.\nTwo additional notes: First, if Global Magic isn't able to guess the word\nphonetically, it will offer a pure phonetic representation. Second, if you change your\nmind, you can always use the \"panic\" macro to get out of the process and just go\nback to writing normally without creating any dictionary entries at all.\nVISUALIZERS:\nD2 - TranslationMagic\nE3a - TranslationMagic Options\n12.8 Boost\nBoost\nAutomatic Speech Recognition technology is not sufficiently powerful to produce\nan accurate transcript without significant editing, and never will be. It cannot reliably\npunctuate, identify speakers, resolve subtle ambiguities, or editorialize obvious verbal\nerrors such as stumbling over words, mumbling, repeating, or overtalk. They also\nmake frequent errors on acoustically similar very short words such as \"an\" and \"in.\"\nHuman reporters do all of these things easily.\nHowever, under ideal conditions, speech recognition engines are quite good at\ndifficult vocabulary or fast speaking, things that human reporters sometimes struggle\nwith. This feature allows you to leverage speech technology to do the one thing it's\ngood at in order to boost your accuracy in places where you need it most.\n286 Eclipse Help\nSetup\nBoost is found under User settings/Translation/Boost.\nThere is an activity slider much like the Translation Magic setting. This allows\nyou to decide how much leeway the Boost system has to help. A low % = low\naggressiveness, means trust what I wrote. A higher % is more aggressive, meaning\ntrust what you heard.\nTranslation 287\nTranslation Magic and Boost are not mutually exclusive and can be used\ntogether, though Translation Magic results will almost always be replaced by speech\nresults. Translation Magic looks for places that you have made errors and tries to fix\nthem. It relies on your spelling dictionary and phonetics, compares it with your\nphonetics table, and it looks at your main dictionary and sees if you wrote something\nclose to it. It uses the steno. Boost uses the audio - it listens to what was actually\nsaid and if it hears something different from what you wrote, it assumes you wrote it\nwrong and it will replace it. It has a higher degree of accuracy than TM.\nSetting the slider to 0 enables on-demand mode which means that it will not\noffer Boost edits unless specifically asked to do so. Any settings from 1 to 100 will\ngive greater weight to the speech results compared with the steno results. Even a\nsetting of 100 will not always use the speech results, however.\nWherever the % is, if it hears terminology and looks in your dictionary and sees\nthat you have no way to write that terminology, regardless of whether it makes a\nreplacement or not, (which is dependent on your settings) it will give you an\nautobrief. It can give you an autobrief for a word it hears before you even write it.\nSelect the appropriate speech engine either Google Speech or Speechmatics.\nRemember you need to have a Boost Box to use Boost without the internet or with\nSpeechmatics. A Boost Box can be purchased from Advantage Software and allows\nusers to use Speechmatics on their systems using a simple crossover cable.\nClick Exceptions to create exceptions to Boost that control the types of\nreplacements and results it will undertake. Words added to the Boost Exceptions list\nwill not be inserted or changed by the featured.\n836\n288 Eclipse Help\nAudio\nClean audio recording in the correct format is necessary. Audio levels, device\nsettings, microphone quality an placement will all have a bearing on how well this\nfeature works.\nIn order for this feature to work, you must make sure that under User\nsettings/Realtime/Audio Recording channel 0 is an audio recording set to either\nOpus or PCM, 16000hz, 16-bit.\nYou can use multi-channel input in order to be able to separately capture each\nindividual speaker for the best possible recording quality.\nYou must have an Internet connection to use this service, and while the beta\nperiod is free, the final release will include some free minutes and a per-minute\ncharge after that.\nOperation\nWhen writing with Boost, the software compares what you write with what the\nspeech results are, concentrating only on the words.\nÂ· If they are the same, it does nothing.\nÂ· If they are different, it compares the confidence scores for the steno with\nthe confidence scores for the speech.\nÂ· If the speech result is better, it will be applied to the text as an edit.\nBoost creates a jobname_AIB.not file containing the voice notes from the\nspeech recognition process. This allows the file to be re-translated with boost help\nwithout re-processing the audio.\n700\n235\nTranslation 289\nBoost can be used either in normal translation or in realtime. In realtime, if you\nhave the \"apply edits\" feature checked, changes made by Boost will be sent to the\nBridge protocol output.\nPreview window: At the bottom of the steno window, in the pane where the\ndictionary entries usually appear, a preview will show up if using Boost in realtime.\nThis shows the intermediate results as they're heard by the speech engine before it\ngenerates the final results that will be applied to the text around 30 seconds later.\nAs a bonus, if any word appears in the preview window that is not in your\ndictionaries, an auto-brief is created for it immediately since it's likely to be special\nvocabulary you haven't defined. The proposed auto-brief will appear in the info-bar.\nBoost can give you a brief for a word you just heard, didn't know how to spell,\nand haven't written yet! An example from the Boost Visualizer is the word Tishuminga\nâ Boost recognized the word as soon as it heard it, and gave a brief for it before the\nreporter had a chance to write it. Here the reporter has not even tried to write the\nword the first time he heard it (A. I grew up in [Tishumingo] Oklahoma\"):\nAnd here, he wrote it the second time he heard it, but in the meantime, the\nBoost recognized it, and filled it in. The yellow background indicates words or parts of\nwords the AI inserted or replaced.\nIn the meantime, Boost has offered an Auto-Brief for the word.\nEdits\nBoost edits will appear as User text style 8. In the example above, it is yellow.\nThe recommendation is to go to User settings/Display/Color selections/User 8\ncolor and set the background color to something obvious; and to set the User\nsettings/Edit/Typed text definitions so that User 8 is no longer considered typedin;\nthis will allow you to easily make globals to words that have had Boost corrections\nmade.\n290 Eclipse Help\nThe corrections are done as minimal edits, so if the original steno was \"align\"\nand the speech result was \"malign\" it will simply add the \"m\" in User 8 color.\nRealtime\nBoost can be used either in normal translation or in realtime. In realtime, if you\nhave the \"apply edits\" feature checked, changes made by Boost will be sent to the\nBridge protocol output.\nAt the bottom of the steno window, in the pane where the dictionary entries\nusually appear, a preview will show up if using Boost in realtime. This shows the\nintermediate results as they're heard by the speech engine before it generates the\nfinal results that will be applied to the text around 30 seconds later.\nYou can re-translate with Boost â if you using Tran and edit, but turn off record\naudio, it will automatically use the audio you already recorded. This is useful if you\nhad poor internet connection during a realtime job.\nAuto-Brief\nAs a bonus, if any word appears in the preview window that is not in your\ndictionaries, an auto-brief is created for it immediately since it's likely to be special\nvocabulary you haven't defined.\nThe algorithm has dozens of hard-line rules about what not to do. It will never\nremove or insert punctuation, or paragraphs, or Q&A or speaker designations because\nspeech engines are terrible at those things! Boost will avoid duplicating words,\ninserting verbal \"noise\" like \"you know\" if the steno reporter has deliberately omitted\nit, and many other rules.\nAuto-briefs suggested by Boost will be labeled with a comment identifier \"AI\" to\nindicate the source, the same way that expert theory hint briefs are marked.\nOn-demand only\nIf you would like to only use this feature on-demand, and take away the ability\nfor it to make judgment calls about what to replace, you can set the boost strength to\nzero(0) but still leave the feature on. Create a dictionary entry of {AIB} and write it\nonly when you want help. It will explicitly request help in that location. This is hardcoded\ninto the software like the {DELETE} stroke. You can, in addition, use a\nmetadictionary entry containing any replacement in order to determine how this entry\ntranslates if the Boost is off or did not hear anything in the spot (for example, {AIB}\n={NULL} would make it invisible.)\nThis stroke can be used to force an Boost replacement in place of this entry,\nmuch like an untranslate or a drop, but unambiguously, since it also no longer\nregisters as a \"pure insert\" the way a drop would (requiring an extra judgment call\nabout duplication and noise.) Note that setting the Boost feature to 0 still allows the\nauto-briefs to be created.\nExceptions\nTranslation 291\nThe algorithm has dozens of hard-line rules about what not to do.

Boost will avoid duplicating words,\ninserting verbal \"noise\" like \"you know\" if the steno reporter has deliberately omitted\nit, and many other rules.\nWhen comparing what you wrote with the speech results, the confidence score\nfor your writing varies depending on many factors. The frequency of use of the entry\nis one of the strongest baseline factors. Misspelled lower-case words are downgraded.\nConflicts are downgraded. Recently created entries (such as job dictionary entries) are\nupgraded based on the frequency of use scores. Longer words are given higher\nconfidence than shorter ones. Slop stroke entries are given the same confidence as\nthe original, but duplicate entries are treated as unique individuals. If you use slop\nstrokes, the Boost will see a much higher confidence level for slop strokes â it uses\nthe confidence level of the word you meant to write, so it is less likely to offer a\nreplacement suggestion. In this example. the original stroke has been written 414094\ntimes, so the confidence level is much higher than the slop stroke, written on 2680\ntimes.\nWhile these rules are entirely internal, you also have the ability to specify userdefined\nrules.\nIn the User Settings/Paragraphs/Advanced settings, there is an \"Boost\nEligible\" checkbox. Uncheck this box for any paragraph type that should never allow\nAI corrections. For example, you may not want to use it for parenthetical paragraphs.\nIn the Speaker table, in the \"Change\" dialog for each speaker, you can also\nuncheck the Boost Eligible flag to prevent AI corrections for any particular speaker.\nThis could be extremely important for witnesses speaking through a translator since\nthe AI is single-language and will attempt to find English word matches for a\nSpanish-speaking witness.\nIf you find Boost too often editing correct steno results and replacing them with\nerrors, there are several things you can do:\n1. Move the slider more towards steno to prioritize the steno results more. This\nboosts the perceived confidence of the steno and will tend to leave steno\nresults alone even if they're wrong.\n2. Improve the speech results with better audio and more initial information. If\nyou build a job dictionary ahead of time, the text of the job dictionary entries\nwill be given to the speech engine, which can include both vocabulary that\nthe engine does not know, and also uncommon words that are phonetically\nambiguous to give the engine a hint about which one is likely to be correct,\nsuch as \"Shirley\" vs. \"surely.\"\n873\n292 Eclipse Help\n3. Use the User settings/Programming/Boost Exceptions list to add words which\nshould disqualify the results if the speech engine hears them. This could\ninclude everything ranging from profane or embarassing words to extremely\ncommon homonyms or other words which the engine gets wrong more often\nthan it gets right.\n4. If you would prefer that specific paragraph types never have Boost edits\ndone, you can specify whether that paragraph type is eligible using a setting\nunder User settings/Paragraphs/Advanced, Boost eligible.\n5. If only certain speakers should not have Boost edits performed, you can also\nspecity whether a speaker is Boost eligible in the speaker table. This could be\nhelpful for particular speakers with difficult accents, or interpreters speaking\nin another language.\nVISUALIZERS:\nvD2b - Boost Setup Changes in Eclipse 11\nD2b - Boost\nD2b - Boost Setup\n12.9 Boost Flow\nBoost Flow\nIn addition to the Boost feature that retroactively performs edits, a \"Boost Flow\"\noption has been added to the Boost dialog.

This text, and the words you use from the Boost Flow feature, will\nbe inserted as user text style 7 to allow for searching and color-coding. The pending\nflow text is shown on a background color matching the auto-brief suggestions pop-up\nwindow.\nThis text will show immediate results from the speech engine, which may not be\nas accurate as final results, and you will occasionally see words change in that window\nas the speech engine gets a better idea of what was said.\nWhile writing, if you can see that the speech engine correctly heard the spoken\nwords, you can choose to hit strokes on the steno machine that use the speech results\ninstead of having to write out the words in steno.\nTranslation 295\nYou do this by defining special strokes in the User settings/Programming/Slop\nStrokes table. These normally replace a steno stroke with a different steno stroke. In\nthis case, they are replacing a steno stroke with speech results.\nUse <number to tell it how many words to USE from the speech results.\nUse >number to tell it how many words to SKIP in the speech results in case\nthere are incorrect words in your way (these will usually be skipped automatically if\nyou skip over the words in your writing and start writing the words that follow in\nsteno.)\nExample:\n-DZ=<1\n-*DZ=<5\nSK=>1\nSK*=>\nIf you leave out the number, then the command will be assumed to mean \"use\nALL\" or \"skip ALL\" and will go all the way to the end of the text that the speech engine\nhas heard so far.\nIf there is a large amount of unused text, the flow buffer will never show more\nthan 50 words. This is normal. It can happen if you allow a large amount of off-therecord\ntext to go into the audio recording (the speech engine cannot tell what should\nbe on the record or not) or if the steno is far ahead of the speech, or if either the\nspeech or steno is very inaccurate such that the feature cannot figure out where they\nare equivalent in order to align them. In all such cases, using the SKIP ALL stroke\nwill clear out the results and start from the current moment in time moving forward in\ncase the content is unusable.\nLet's look at a concrete example of Flow being used to fill in selected words.\nImagine that the -DZ was being used as the \"use 1\" stroke (>1) meaning to use\none word from the speech engine.\nImagine that the spoken words were as follows:\nI lived in Tishomingo, Oklahoma for many years.\nAnd the speech engine produced these results:\nI live in Tishomingo Oklahoma for men years.\nYou could write:\nEU HREUFD -PB -DZ -RBGS -DZ TPOR PH-PB KWRAOERS -FPLT\nbecause even though the speech engine incorrectly recognized several words,\nand didn't provide punctuation, it still understood the difficult words, and the other\nresults were close enough for Eclipse to be able to match up the results, allowing you\nto cherry-pick the words that might not be in your dictionary or might be difficult to\nwrite.\n296 Eclipse Help\nWhen you use Boost Flow, the words from the speech engine are inserted into\nyour translation EXACTLY like voisteno from a voice writer, which means they aren't\nsteno at all, but they can be manipulated exactly like steno can. That means that you\ncan create dictionary entries that use these voisteno strokes, and you can also use the\n* {DELETE} stroke to remove them and re-write them in case you accidentally use an\nincorrect word and want to change your mind. It's a completely seamless, realtime\nhybrid of speech recognition and steno input.\nThe results from above, in the steno window would look like this:\nEU\nHREUFD\n-PB\nTishomin+\ngo\n-RBGS\nOklahoma\nTPOR\nPH-PB\nKWRAOERS\n-FPLT\nBoost Flow Macros\n{M:Use Flow To - RT}\nWhen you hit this macro, it displays a steno window. Hit the strokes for the\nword/phrase you're targeting and then hit the OK stroke (-RBGS). So, let's say this\nwas defined as TA*OUZ and the flow looked like this:\nthis is steno [and this is a bunch of text the speech engine has provided did You want to use up to the word \"did\" but no further, because you want to write a\n{Q} stroke (or punctuate, or write a speaker, or whatever.) Just write TA*OUZ TKEUD\n-RBGS and it will use everything in the buffer right through the word \"provided\" and\nthen stop here:\nths is steno and this is a bunch of text the speech engine has provided [did you You can then write your {Q}/punctuation/speaker/etc. and keep going.\n{M:Skip Flow To - RT}\nSame principle. Write this macro, then a dictionary entry, then OK, and it will SKIP\nto that word instead of using.\n{M:Use Flow To Cap - RT}\nA macro for when you can see that Speechmatics thinks there should be a new\nsentence and has capitalized a word (but Eclipse is discarding punctuation since it's\nfrequently wrong.)\nTranslation 297\nBEFORE: this is steno [and this is a bunch of text This is a new sentence]\nIf you write {M:Use Flow To Cap - RT} you'll end up with:\nAFTER: this is steno and this is a bunch of text [This is a new sentence]\nThen you can write period/comma/paragraph/whatever and then keep using more\nof the results.\n{M:Edit Here - RT}\nThis macro now not only goes into edit mode, but will first USE all of the strokes\nin the flow buffer. That means if you see that the speech engine is nailing everything,\nyou can use Edit Here and switch into editing and not miss any words.\nYou can then use cursor movements, editmode macros for paragraphs,\npunctuation, replacements, globals, fixing, etc., all from the writer, while the speech\nengine streams the draft text right into the document ahead of you. Note that in this\ncase, the punctuation and paragraphing coming from the speech system IS being\nused, so you'll want to have , = {,} and . = {.} voisteno entries in your dictionary,\nand SP01 = {S:SPEAKER01} or whatever entries if you're connected to Zoom or a\nmulti-channel microphone system. This technique allows steno/voice reporters to\nleverage all of the features available to RSR reporters when toggling into edit mode\nand letting the speech system take over writing the first draft. Except you can use\nsteno/voice for editing, which is obviously a much faster text composition mechanism\nthan qwerty.\nTo take back over from the steno machine, use:\n{M:Panic Stroke - RT}\nExactly as you would normally when wanting to resume writing.\nWhen in editmode, the speech settings for \"follow behind X words\" and \"allow\ndeletions\" are now relevant, and it will determine how fast the draft text is added to\nthe document (as opposed to sitting in the pending translation.) Because it's so\nimportant to get fast results, you can set this quite low if you prefer speed over\naccuracy. It has been tested with follow behind set to 3 words and it worked fine, with\nhigh quality audio.\nWe did several short tests toggling into and out of editmode, switching from the\nreporter writing and/or using flow, and the speech writing and the reporter editing,\nand even during continuous speech input, the transitions were seamless. It's still\ngoing to take some experimentation to see what curveballs real world material throws\nat it, but it seems promising.\nAppearance\n298 Eclipse Help\nBoost Flow text will appear as User text style 7.

Also, there are options\nrelated to editing, like audio playback and by-line generation.\nEditing A Transcript 307\nThe Keyboard button opens the Keyboard Definitions dialog, in which all\nkeystrokes and hyperkeys can be reassigned.\nThe Macros button opens the Macros dialog, in which you can create or\nchange macros.\nThe \"By\" formats button opens the By Line Formats dialog, in which you can\ncontrol the appearance of your by lines.\nThe Spell options button opens the Spell Check Options dialog, in which you\ncan set preferences related to checking spelling and grammar.\nEditing options\nÂ· Spacebar Commands: Makes the spacebar behave as a Ctrl key. For\nexample, pressing the spacebar and the Q key would be the same as pressing\nCtrl+Q.\nÂ· Reverse ? and /: Allows you to type a question mark without pressing shift\nwhile editing. You can also mark the checkbox for ? / in text boxes to use this\nfeature within form fields and within edit boxes, such as during globaling.\nÂ· Jump Punctuation Left: If checked, when you insert a punctuation mark into\nthe middle of a word, it will appear to the left of the word instead. If\nunchecked, this mark will appear at the cursor location. See the page on\nWorking with Punctuation for more details.\nÂ· Allow Punctuation Toggle: If checked, you can remove a punctuation mark\nby pressing the key you would use to insert it. For example, if a period is\nalready present, pressing the period key would remove it.\n1008\n683\n1014\n464\n383\n687\n308 Eclipse Help\nÂ· Auto Capitalization: If checked, Eclipse will automatically capitalize a word\nthat should be capitalized when you pass the cursor over it. It does not have\nany effect on words capitalized by automatic punctuation.\nÂ· Edit station user: If checked, Eclipse will behave as an Edit Station (scopist's\nversion of Eclipse). The Edit station user checkbox is followed by a number\nwhich can go from 0 to 8. Setting this to 0 will use the scopist text type, but 1\n- 8 will use the user 1 - user 8 type. Note that even if the Edit station user\ncheckbox is off, the text type selected here will be used to indicate the\nproofreading marks created in any of the e-book proofreading, Bridge Mobile\nproofreading, or PDF proofreading features. If you have a full system and are\nscoping for someone else, checking this will allow your changes to appear in a\ndifferent color. See Color Selections .\nÂ· Paragraph status: Clicking the Paragraph status button displays the\nParagraph status dialog . Up to 8 user-definable statuses can be created.\nThere are some default values that are suggested, but these are completely\narbitrary and can be replaced at will and used in whatever way you would like.\nÂ· Stitch: Controls how words appear when stitched. Your choices are:\no S-M-I-T-H: Will stitch the word in All Caps.\no S-m-i-t-h: Will stitch the word using its current capitalization.\no S-m-i-t-h: Will stitch the word in lower case.\nÂ· Timed Auto Backup saves an extra copy of your work. If set to a number\nabove 0, Eclipse will create a series of backup files, as frequently as you\nspecify, named jobname.bk0, jobname.bk1, jobname.bk2, etc. up to\njobname.bk9. A setting of 30 would create a new backup every 30 minutes.\nTo revert to the backed-up version of the job, use the Revert button in the File\nManager . When you press the Revert button, it displays a list of all of the backup\nfiles for the current job. The one you select will be copied over the Jobname.ecl in the\njobs folder. Note that this does NOT save the original Jobname.ecl file anywhere. You\nshould NOT use Revert unless the current version of the file is unsalvageable. (Note:\nThe Revert button will also work with dictionary files, and .ini files, displaying a list of\nthe last 10 backups for those file types as well as transcripts.)\nThe files are saved in the backup folder, which by default is \"\\Eclipse backups.\"\nYou can change the location of the backup folder in User settings/Programming/File\nlocations/BACKUP=. The .bk files are copies of the .ECL transcript file that can be\nreverted to in the event of a catastrophic error. This is what the Revert button does; it\nswitches back to the previously saved version of the job, allowing you to switch to a\nversion of the job that predates the error. The next time you open the .ECL file, it will\nbe the older, reverted-to version.\nHaving a series of backup files will allow you to go back to an even older version\nof the file if the most recent backup contains an error that you were trying to recover\nfrom (such as a disastrous block-delete or ill-advised text global.) If you have your\nbackup interval set to 30 minutes, for example, it will keep the last five hours worth\nof backups.\nSee Visualizer\n125\n350\n680\n311\nEditing A Transcript 309\nGlobaling options\nÂ· Global After Scan: If checked, Eclipse will automatically open an untranslate\nfor globaling when you scan to it. This saves you the step of having to press\nCtrl+G or a hyperkey to begin the global . See Visualizer\nÂ· Automatic Spelling: If checked, Eclipse will prompt you if you attempt to\nglobal an incorrectly spelled word. (If unchecked, you will still have the option\nto spell-check manually, from the globaling dialog.\nÂ· Global Magic: If checked, Global Magic will be enabled. If unchecked,\nEclipse will not offer translation suggestions in the global dialog.\nÂ· Detect Conflicts: If checked, Eclipse will warn you if you attempt to global a\npiece of steno that is already in a dictionary. You will be told what dictionary it\nis in, and given options to Overwrite, Keep Original, Create Conflict, or cancel.\nSee Visualizer\nÂ· Speech Auto-Play: Pertains to voicewriting . If checked, Eclipse will\nautomatically play the underlying sound when you begin a global.\nÂ· Audio Auto: Pertains to sound files recorded with the Record Audio option, or\nthe \"room track\" if you are a voicewriter. It takes effect when you are globaling\nor typing in text. There are 5 options in a drop-down list:\no None will take no action.\no Play will play the audio when you finish typing or globaling, even if you were\nnot listening to the audio before.\no Stop will stop the audio when you begin a global or typing in text.\no Both will stop the audio when you begin globaling or typing, and play it\nagain when finished.\no Pause will pause and unpause, instead of stopping and starting.\nThe difference between pause/unpause and stop and start is this - stop means\nstop and start a whole new playback, and play means start where my cursor is.\nUnPause resumes playing where you were when it paused. These have different uses\ndepending on whether you are editing the whole document or doing spot edits.\nYou can also use foot pedals to stop and play. There are 6 macros, with defaults\nfor play, rewind, and fast forward.\nÂ· Typed text definitions: If you mark a block of text and select Format/Text\ntype, a menu opens that lists every different type of text that Eclipse\nsupports. The Typed text definitions button opens a similar menu, in which\nyou can select and unselect text types that you wish to define as typed-in\ntext. Unselecting a user-defined type frees it to be used to designate\nTranslation Magic results and/or Integral prefixes and suffixes, for example.\n339\n326 311\n331\n331\n311\n1164\n310 Eclipse Help\nÂ· The Dictionary and Capped list boxes control the default destination of\nglobals. When you press Enter to finish a global, it will go to the Capped\nlocation if it the definition is capitalized, and to the Dictionary location if it is\nnot. (Capitalized definitions are often proper nouns; you may want to have\nthose default to the Job dictionary.)\nAudio options\nThe Audio playback button opens the Audio playback controls dialog. You\ncan also open this by going to the Tools menu/Multimedia/Control panel\n(Ctrl+Shift+A). You can set options here to adjust playback speed and skip over\npauses.\nNote that when you are playing back an audio file, information about the file will\nappear on the Infobar, including the filename and how the file was recorded: the\ncompression (PCM, GSM, Speex) and sampling rate, bit width, etc. (Note that Speex\nfiles are not playable in Windows 10, so if you attempt to play a Speex WAV file,\nEclipse will detect this non-playable Speex files and will ask if you wish to\nautomatically convert it to a playable format. It will rename the original to\njobname_speex.wav and will make the jobname.wav a Windows codec of comparable\nquality (creating a larger file in the process.))\nIt also shows shows which channel is playing, and what your current speed and\nthreshold percentage values are that were used to play the file.\nAudio channels will are numbered starting with zero, which corresponds to\njobname.wav. The next channel will be 1 and will correspond to jobname_1.wav, then\n2 will be jobname_2.wav, etc. When doing multi-channel recording, channel 0\n(jobname.wav) is always the MIX of the other channels. That way, the other channels\nnumbered 1 through N will match up with the channel numbers of the recording\ndevices. It also means that the mix is the channel that will be shared with the Team\nEditors, and is the channel that will be sent to the ASR, if applicable. The \"mix\"\nfeature will work for mixing the audio from multiple single-channel devices, including\nthe built-in microphones on laptops, in addition to working for multiplexed audio\ndevices.\nEditing A Transcript 311\nNote that Eclipse stores the device names separately. If you have several audio\ndevices plugged into USB ports, they could be plugged in in a different order from one\nday to the next. To make sure the device settings are correctly assigned to each\ndevice, when loading the user settings, it checks the list of available devices to see if\nthe previously selected device has changed to a different number, and will move to\nthat device number if it has. That ensures that the correct device will always be\nselected if it is present when you run Eclipse. (If it is not present, no change is\nmade.)\nÂ· The Speed spin box or slider allows you to change the speed of the audio\nplayback. The default setting is 100. The number is a percentage: a setting of\n75 would be 75% of normal speed, 50 would have half-speed, etc. The speed\nis changed in a way that minimizes distortion of the deponent's voice. (This\ncan also be accessed via the Tools menu/ Multimedia/Control Panel .)\nÂ· The Volume Threshold spin box or slider allows you to filter out background\nnoise. If set to a number above 0, all sounds below that percentage level will\nbe skipped over, skipping over pauses, and making the deponent's voice\neasier to hear. You will have to experiment to find the right setting. The\nmaximum setting is 99. (This can also be accessed via the Tools menu/\nMultimedia/Control Panel .)\nÂ· The Play button will play the audio for the current transcript. This allows you\nto test the effects of changes to Speed and Volume Threshold without leaving\nthe dialog.\nÂ· The Clean play function plays the sound exactly as recorded rather than the\naudio filtered through the speed and volume threshold controls, letting you\nhear exactly what was recorded without forcing you to change your carefully\ntuned settings.\nÂ· If Play on exit is checked, audio will begin playing automatically once you\nclose the Multimedia Control Panel. This saves you having to press Alt+J\nonce you return to the transcript.\nÂ· If Move cursor is checked, each time you play audio in a transcript file, the\ncursor will move through the transcript to keep up with the audio as it plays. If\nthis is not checked, the cursor will not follow along.\nÂ· The Timecodes.. button goes directly to the same dialog that appears under\nUser settings/Document/Timecodes.\nVISUALIZERS:\nE3 - Globaling Intro\nF2 - Globaling Options\nE3a - Global Magic\nJ3b - BAK files\nD4b - Audio Auto\nD4b - Audio Options - Play and Pause\nD4d - Multi-Channel playback\nE4b - By-Lines\nC1 - Keyboard Changes\n1033\n1033\n1064\n1064\n312 Eclipse Help\nG5 - Macros\nE9 - Spellcheck\n13.3 Cursor Movements\nBasic Cursor Movements\nsee below for keystrokes\nBasic Cursor Movements For Text Files\nMovement Moves The Cursor..

Hyperkeys come preprogrammed in Eclipse, but can be changed by the user. A\nchart of the default Hyperkeys is in your documentation folder (Support\nmenu/Documentation). Printable keyboard layout templates are included on the\nEclipse disk.\nWhen the Hyperkeys feature is turned on, a single key specifies a shortcut. In\nother words, keystrokes no longer result in standard text entry. If you are unfamiliar\nwith Eclipse Hyperkeys and begin seeing unexpected editing actions while you are\nediting, you may have accidentally turned on the Hyperkeys feature. This can quickly\nbe determined by checking the status bar. The âHYPâ abbreviation appears in the\nstatus bar of the main window when Hyperkeys are on. A checkmark also appears\nnext to the Hyperkeys menu item when the feature is on.\nIf you find yourself in an unexpected place in the document because of\nHyperkeys being on, just hit escape if in a dialog, followed by the \"Last edit point\"\ncommand (the Movement Oops command), which is Hyperkey Shift+Z or\nShift+Alt+L.\nTo turn Hyperkeys off, select the menu item, or press Alt+Z, or click the\nHyperkeys toolbar button.\nTo print a list of Hyperkey and standard keyboard assignments:\n687\n683\n317\n316 Eclipse Help\n1. Go to User settings (Alt+U).\n2. Select the Edit tab.\n3. Click the Keyboard button. The Keyboard definitions dialog appears.\n4. Click the Print button. The Print dialog appears. Make any necessary\nselections in this window, and then select OK. Two lists are printed: one for\nuser-defined assignments on the standard keyboard, the other for Hyperkey\nassignments.\nThe Reference Guide contains the default standard keyboard assignments ,\narranged according to function; and the default Hyperkeys .\nType in text or inserting text when in Hyperkeys\nTo type in or insert text in a document when your Hyperkeys are turned on (with\nthe standard set of Hyperkeys) simply press N, insert your text, and then press Enter\nto return to Hyperkeys. Another shortcutâShift+Alt+Nâwill accomplish the same\nthing. When you are in Type Text mode, TYP will appear in the status bar.\nThis command is used to suspend Hyperkeys temporarily so that text can be\nentered from the keyboard. Otherwise, you would have to turn Hyperkeys off, enter\ntext, and then turn Hyperkeys back on. When the Hyperkeys suspend command is\nselected, Hyperkeys stops functioning. Type the desired text and press Enter.\nHyperkeys resume functioning.\nThe functions that apply automatic punctuation rules and typing a number to\nchoose a conflict are disabled when you have suspended hyperkeys to type in text.\nUsing Hyperkeys and AutoMagic\nIf you wish to use the default Hyperkeys for 7, 8, 9 and 0, you can use Shift+7,\nor Ctrl+7, etc., whatever number key combinations are not already in use, to select\nnumbered items from the AutoMagic list.\nUnique hyperkeys\nSome of the hyperkeys run macros to help with editing, and don't have an\nanalogous keystroke of menu item. For example, lower case x (for eXtend Sentence)\ncan be used if you realize you missed some words at the end of a sentence. With your\ncursor anywhere in the sentence, press x and the cursor will jump to the end of the\nsentence, and remove any terminal punctuation, so you can just begin typing to\ninsert what you missed.\nOther hyperkeys save keystrokes while editing, such as O (which jumps the\ncursor to the left by two words) and o (which jumps to the right by two words).\nVISUALIZERS:\nA7 - Hyperkeys\nC1 Keyboard Changes - Hyperkey Customization\n770 772\n777\nEditing A Transcript 317\nM3 - AutoMagic Display\nM3a Auto-Magic Numbered Choices\n13.5.1 Type Text\nType Text\nHyperkey N\nEdit/Insert/Type in text\nTemporarily suspends hyperkeys so you can type text.

Press Enter a second time. This will remove the old word.\nWhen you do this, an entry is created in the Typeover Tracking list.\nThe next time you edit that word, Eclipse will first suggest the new word you\njust inserted. If you don't want to use it, just start typing and it will go away.\nIf you do want to use it, hit Enter and it will replace the word you are typing\nover.\nTo toggle hyperkeys on and off permanently, use the Hyperkeys\ncommand (Alt+Z).\nNOTE: This command does have a non-hyperkey keystroke, Ctrl+N.\nHowever, it is only needed when creating macros. See the page on macro\ndesign considerations .\n13.6 Insert/Overtype Mode\nInsert/Overtype\nInsert key\n683\n884\n315\n1014\n318 Eclipse Help\nThe Edit menu/Insert/Insert/overtype mode choice toggles between insert\nand overtype modes. These modes affect how entered text affects existing text.\nIn insert mode, text entered from the keyboard is added at the current cursor\nposition. Existing text to the right of the cursor is pushed to the right as new text is\nentered.\nIn overtype mode, each new character that is entered replaces the existing\ncharacter to the right of the cursor, until the end of a word is reached. If the new\nword you are typing is longer than the one you are typing over, additional characters\nare inserted as in insert mode so you don't run over the following word. You can use\novertype as an easy way to replace a single word without having to select the word\nfirst.\nYou can remove the original word (in insert mode) or the remainder of the\nexisting word (in overtype mode) by pressing Enter when you've finished typing.\nWhen insert mode is selected, the text INS appears on the right-hand side of\nthe status bar .

The\nsystem will then find the next speaker belonging to that group.\nIf you enter a Speaker name in the Find text box, select Appearing in..\nParagraphs, and select Speaker, the system will then find the next speaker with\nthat name. It will search in both the Speaker paragraphs, and the By lines.\nTo search for a paragraph type or print command, click either the Paragraph or\nPrint Command option button, and then select the desired item from the drop-down\nlist below.\nThe Appearing in: option can be used by itself, or in combination with a string\nof text. For example, if you type \"the\" in the Find text box and select the Question\nparagraph style, the search will stop only on instances of the word \"the\" that appear\nin Questions.

They can be used to address common\ntypographical errors, or to create fast ways to type long phrases. A list of common\nerrors is included with the eclipse.set file. This list consists of two text strings that\nare separated by an equal sign. When the string on the left is typed in a document,\nEclipse automatically replaces it with the string on the right. For example, the entry,\n\"adn=and\" would automatically correct \"adn\" with \"and\". The list is located in the\nUser settings/Programming tab, and you can add, delete, and modify any words\non the list.\nYou can also use autoreplacements to create abbreviations that make your typing\nmore efficient (e.g. DOJ=Department of Justice).\nThe syntax for an Autoreplacement entry is:\nword=replacement\nSome sample autoreplacement entries:\n173\n826\n826\nEditing A Transcript 325\nWhenever you type what is on the left-hand side of the equals sign, it will be\nautomatically replaced by whatever is on the right. For example, if you type \"adn\", it\nwill automatically be changed to \"and.\"\nTo create an autoreplacement, simply type it into the list, using the\nword=replacement syntax. You may also delete or edit autoreplacements, just by\nediting the list as text.\nThe list of autoreplacements is automatically sorted alphabetically. You do not\nhave to put new autoreplacements in their precise location; you can place new entries\nanywhere you like, as long as the word=replacement syntax is followed for each\nindividual entry, .\nAutoreplacements can also be created during globaling . To do this, type the\nautoreplacements text into the globaling window. For example, if you type\n\"OSC=Okaloosa Springs Casualty\" in the globaling window, you will be asked if you\nwant to create an autoreplacement.\n326\n326 Eclipse Help\nFor more details on creating and editing Autoreplacements, see the\nProgramming Tab help file .\nVISUALIZERS:\nG4 - Autoreplacements\nG4 - Autoreplacements While globaling\n13.14 Global\nGlobal\nSingle-stroke: Ctrl+G/hyperkey G\nor Edit/Global..\nMulti-stroke: see below\nGlobaling is a way of addressing untranslated steno in a transcript text file .\nGlobaling an untranslate will also correct it in that location, and give you a chance to\ncorrect it throughout the transcript, and/or place it into a dictionary .\nThe global command (Ctrl+G or hyperkey G) selects the current steno outline\nfor globaling, and opens the global dialog where you can type a definition. You can\nalso decide how the global should apply to the rest of the transcript, and/or what\ndictionary it should be placed into.\n826\n327\n694\n672\n331\nEditing A Transcript 327\nGlobal Magic\nSee Visualizer\nIf you go to the Edit tab of User settings and select Global magic, Eclipse will\ntry to figure out what you might be trying to global, and it will create a list of possible\nchoices in a small tool window directly beneath the text box in the globaling window.\nThis window will contain a series of up to 10 underlined numbers. You can select\nthe item that matches what you were trying to global by simply typing that number.\nIf what you want is not on the list, type it and the list will disappear. (Hitting any key\nwill remove the list.)\nWhen adding a dictionary entry, Global Magic will offer suggestions based on\nexisting dictionary entries and spelling dictionary contents. It will also work when\nglobaling in entries from a raw note file based on the same principles.\nIf you use a Hyperkey such as 7 or 8 to global two or three strokes, Global Magic\nwill wait for all the strokes to be highlighted before looking for replacements.\nGlobal magic uses Intelligent phonetics, and understands dragged and dropped\nkeys, and steno stacking to decide what words to suggest.\nGlobaling Tips\nÂ· You do not need to mark steno before performing the global. Whether you mark it\nor not, you will have to option to perform a text global , if you mark the \"Text\"\nbox, which is always off by default. Most globals are steno globals (meaning that\na the definition is assigned to a piece of steno).\nÂ· The steno you are globaling will appear in the title bar of the global dialog . You\ncan check here to make sure you've selected the correct steno.\n331\n1062\n331\n328 Eclipse Help\nÂ· When you global something, it will be adjusted for its current location in the\ntranscript. For example, if you global an untranslate at the beginning of a\nsentence, it will automatically be capitalized. If you global something adjacent to\na punctuation mark, the mark will automatically be positioned.\nÂ· When defining a global, do not capitalize it unless it is always capitalized.\nÂ· You may global any piece of steno, not just untranslates. The globaling process\nworks the same for a translated piece of steno as it does for an untranslate. If\nyou can't select the exact steno you want, use the Reverse Tran command to\nrevert the steno into an untranslate.\nÂ· If you make a mistake when globaling, you may simply re-global it. (The Undo\ncommand will not reverse the global.) If you globalled something into a\ndictionary and don't want it there at all, you will have to open the dictionary\nand delete the entry from there.\nÂ· If you check the \"Prompt\" box before accepting the global, then it will display\neach instance of the replacement in the document and will ask yes/no if you want\nto replace it for each instance.\nGlobal Types\nWhen you have entered the desired definition for the global, you need to select\nthe type of global it is. A global's type determines which dictionary it goes into (if\nany), and whether or not the rest of the transcript is impacted. Here are the global\ntypes:\nÂ· Main - Ctrl+M (see also next paragraph). Places the entry into the main\ndictionary. Applies through the end of the job; this means that all other instances\nof the same steno in this job will be changed.\nÂ· Job - Ctrl+J. Places the entry into the job dictionary. Applies through the end of\nthe job.\nÂ· Trash - Ctrl+T. Applies through the end of the job, but is not placed in any\ndictionary.\nÂ· Local - Ctrl+L. Applies to this location only. Does not go into any dictionary.\nÂ· User 1, User 2, etc through User 8 - Ctrl+1, Ctrl+2, etc through Ctrl+8.\nPlaces the entry into the selected User dictionary.\n357\n318\n1035\n328\nEditing A Transcript 329\nÂ· Browse - Ctrl+B. Allows you to select a specific dictionary from the file dialog\n. If you select a dictionary not being used in the current translation, it places a\ncopy of the entry in the temporary ($tranjob.dix) dictionary, just as it would with\na trash global, so it will be available for the rest of the job.\nPressing Enter will execute the default global type. This is usually a Main global,\nbut it is user-definable under global options on the Edit tab.\nFor more information about Job, User, and other dictionaries, see Working With\nMultiple Dictionaries .\nMulti-Stroke Globals\nIf you are using the standard keystroke Ctrl+G, you can add strokes to the\nglobal by pressing Ctrl+G multiple times. Each keypress will add an additional steno\noutline to the global.\nIf you are using hyperkeys, the keystroke G will perform a one-stroke global. To\ndo a multi-stroke global, press hyperkey 7 (for a two-stroke global), 8 (for three\nstrokes), 9 (for four strokes), or 0 (for five strokes) instead of hyperkey G. (In other\nwords, do not push G and then a number key.)\nYou can also add/subtract strokes to a global by using arrow keys:\nÂ· Up Arrow: add stroke to left.\nÂ· Down Arrow: subtract stroke from left.\nÂ· Ctrl+Down Arrow: add stroke to right.\nÂ· Ctrl+Up Arrow: subtract stroke from right.\nThe arrow keys will work regardless of how you began the global. It does not\nmatter if you used the standard key Ctrl+G, hyperkey G, or any of the multi-stroke\nglobal hyperkeys.\nGlobaling Options\nThere are several options pertaining to globaling on the Edit tab of User\nSettings .\n969\n309\n675\n309\n330 Eclipse Help\nGlobal after scan: Combining Globaling and Scanning\nYou can set Eclipse to open automatically a globaling window when a scan stops\non an untranslate. To set this option, go to User Settings/Edit tab and mark the\nGlobal after scan checkbox.\nAutomatic spelling and Spellchecking while globaling\nTo check the spelling of text in the text entry field of the Globaling dialog, click\nthe Spelling button. This opens the spellchecker window, which provides a list of\nrecognized words similar to the selected text. At the top of the window is the\nmisspelled word (under Original).

For example, if you global PET/TEUGS as \"petition\", you will\nreceive the suggestions PET/EUGS and PE/TEUGS. In the original global, the T sound\nis included in both the initial stroke and the second stroke (pet/tition); in each of the\nsuggestions, it is in one or the other (pet/ition and pe/tition).\nIntegral prefixes/suffixes suggestions offer you versions of the word you had\ngloballed, with additional final-side keys added to produce different tenses: -G for ing,\n-D for ed, -S for s, etc. For example, if you global the steno SRAOU as \"view\", you\nwould be offered SRAOUD=viewed, SRAOUG=viewing, and SRAOUS=views.\nMisstrokes, as the name suggests, are possible misstrokes for the selected\nsteno. Be careful accepting misstroke suggestions, however: each piece of steno can\nhave dozens of possible misstrokes. Furthermore, if you are also using the other\nsuggestions, you'll get misstroke versions of those suggestions as well. If you\nindiscriminately accept misstroke suggestions, your dictionary can soon balloon to an\nunmanageable size. Be judicious when accepting misstrokes; accept only those that\nreflect your writing style.\nDepending on the nature of the steno outline, you may get suggestions from one\nor more categories.

You could simply select that, but what if you wanted to\ndefine STHAP as {=STPHAP} instead? This would indicate that that dictionary entry is\nactually a slop stroke for âsnapâ and not a good entry for âsnap.â\nWhen the Global Magic suggestions appear, you can hit F9 (think of it as the\nâview dictionaryâ keystroke) to toggle the suggestions window.

You might want to track your\nprogress for sections at a time, rather than the whole transcript at once. The\nParagraph status feature enables you to assign a status to any number of\nparagraphs, and see at a glance where work has been done, or not.\nYou can assign up to 8 statuses that you use by going to User\nsettings/Edit tab and clicking the Paragraph status button. The\nParagraph Status dialog opens.\nEditing A Transcript 351\nThere are 6 default statuses - rough, scoped, edited, proofread,\nfinal, reverted, and broadcast (which is at the end, because it is particular\nto captioners -- when sending scripts, this will automatically indicate which\nparagraphs have been sent). You can use these statuses or replace any of\nthem. The reverted status is used if you are a scopist in an editing team and\na document reconciliation is required due to a simultaneous edit or a\nconnection issue. It will mark any paragraph that had to be reverted to the\nreporter's version in the reverted color. You may want to double-check these\nparagraphs to see if any edits did not make it from the scopist to the\nreporter.Note that if you remove or rename the reverted status, the\ndocument reconciliation process will no longer attempt to flag paragraphs\nwhich have been re-transmitted from the reporter during a reconciliation.\nIn the text boxes, describe what you want that status to indicate.\nClicking a Color button opens the standard color selection dialog, where you\ncan select a background color to be displayed on the screen. In order to avoid\njarring display issues, you should choose background colors that are very\nclose to your normal page background. For example, if you use a white\nbackground, make these very light pastels.\nNote: The paragraph status colors are only visible if you have User\nsettings/Display/Print commands turned ON, much like lockspaces. If you\nhave the print commands turned off, then the paragraph status colors do not\nappear on screen.\nThere are several ways to assign a status to a paragraph or group of\nparagraphs:\n362\n352 Eclipse Help\nÂ· If you hit Home twice and Insert/modify paragraph (F8) or hit the\nparagraph button in the paragraph bar, the Paragraph data dialog\nopens. Click the Status button which opens a dialog where you can\nselect which statuses are true for the current paragraph. Note that\nthese are each separate on/off switches and you can select as many\nas are relevant. In the example below, when you click OK, you will\nmark the current paragraph as \"edited\" and \"proofread.\"\nÂ· If you Mark a block and hit Insert/modify paragraph (F8) you\nwill get a pick list of all the paragraph types. At the end of the list is a\n[Set paragraph status] item. Select that to see the paragraph\nstatus choices. Any paragraph status you select will be applied to all\nof the paragraphs in the block.\nÂ· You can automatically set paragraph status that will apply to all the\nwork you are doing right now, until you change it. Use the User\nsettings/Edit/Paragraph status dialog. Next to each status is a\ncheckbox. Check the box next to the statuses that represent what you\nare doing right now. By default, none are checked, meaning that\nthere is no assigned paragraph status. The statuses you select will be\nassigned to paragraphs when your cursor leaves the paragraph.\nSo, for example, you might select \"rough\" and then start a realtime\ntranslation. As you write, each paragraph will get set to \"rough\" status.\nWhen you go back to edit, you uncheck \"rough\" and check \"edited\" and\nstart editing the document. As you move through the document, the cursor\n\"paints\" the paragraphs with the edited color, indicating that you have been\nthere.\nWhen you have finished editing, you may decide to do one pass of\nproofreading and call it a final transcript all in one step, so you go back and\nyou uncheck \"edited' and check \"proofread\" and \"final.\" On the final pass, it's\nmarking all of the paragraphs with both \"proofread\" and \"final.\"\n343\n394\nEditing A Transcript 353\nThis use case demonstrates that you can leave old statuses (\"rough\") in\nplace, you can ignore statuses (\"scoped\" was not used) and you can assign\nmultiple statuses at once.\nWhen you assign multiple statuses to a paragraph or paragraphs, they\nwill be displayed on your screen as partially overlapping background colors,\nso look at the left side of the screen to see which are on or off. The majority\nof the screen shows you the lowest status that is relevant, so when you set\nup your list of statuses, put them in the chronological order that you intend\nto use them.\nFinally, if you wish to get a bird's-eye, big picture view of the statuses\nin the entire transcript, use the Tools/Job report feature. The drop-list\nallows you to select between looking at the list of commands and looking at\nthe list of statuses. If you have marked a block of text, you can also choose a\ngraph of your words per minute in that block.\n354 Eclipse Help\nIf you look at the list of statuses, you will see a graph of the entire\ndocument, with the statuses filled in using the appropriate status colors, and\nwith a percentage telling you how much of the document has reached what\nstate. You can left-click anywhere in the status graph to jump to that location\nin the transcript. A gap in the line of color indicates a place where that task\nwas not completed.\n13.22.5 Right-click on text\nRight-click on text\nYou can right-click on text to get a pop-up window listing many actions\nyou might use while editing.\nEditing A Transcript 355\nIf you click on Properties..., the Text attributes dialog opens.\nIf you click on Paragraphs, submenu Properties, you will have direct\naccess to the Paragraph data dialog.\nIn the Paragraph data dialog, you can modify the font, label, spacing,\ntext type, and status of that paragraph.\n356 Eclipse Help\n13.23 Miscellaneous Editing Commands\nMiscellaneous editing commands\nsee below for keystrokes\nThese commands, with one exception, are for working in text files .

Then, press\nShift+Alt+C or select Edit Timecodes from the menu. The Edit timecodes dialog\nwill appear:\nTo manipulate timecodes, enter the desired starting timecode into the box for\nthe type of timecode you wish to change (Absolute or Relative). Alternatively, you\ncan use the spin controls to increase/ decrease the time. The large up/down buttons\nat right will change both sets of timecodes; the two smaller pairs of buttons at left\nwill change only one timecode. These buttons will impact the part of the time where\nthe cursor is: if it is on the hour segment (the left-most one), the buttons will\nincrease/decrease the hour. You may also use the up/down arrow keys to do this.\nTimes are represented in the format 00:00:00:00. That's hours, seconds,\nminutes, and frames (of video). There are 30 frames in a second.\nWhen you make a change, the text at right will update to indicate the new range\nof timecodes. This allows you to see the effects of the change before you accept them.\nIn the above example, the absolute timecodes for the marked block will start at\n3:27:42:20 and end at 3:27:48:20. Similarly, the absolute timecodes will start at\n13:10:55:24 and end at 13:11:01:24.\n264\n224\n436 434\n394\nEditing A Transcript 359\nThe Capture button captures the current time, and assigns it to the first steno\nstroke in the block you have selected. The remaining timecodes in the block will\nincrement from there.\nApply offset will show you what the printed/exported timecodes will look like as\nyou are editing them. That means that offset will be applied so that you can see what\nthe final result will look like and you don't have to add or subtract the offset in your\nhead in order to achieve that.\nIt can be confusing to edit timecodes. There are absolute and relative\ntimecodes, which are separate and unique. There is a timecode offset that affects\neverything. Timecodes appear in the steno window, on the status bar, and in the\nprintable area of the screen to simulate what will show on the PDF, ASCII or printout.\nAdding to the confusion is the fact that the PRINTABLE timecodes that show up in the\ndocument display are ones where the offset has been added, but the ACTUAL\ntimecodes in the notebar (and in the status bar) are the real timecodes in the\ndocument, without the offset applied. Captioners usually have timecodes visible in the\ndocument, not the steno window, in order to make it easier to match up the\ntimecodes with the text. So they're generally looking at the adjusted ones. Which is\nalso what's used when exporting to various captioning output formats.\nIf you have a need to edit the actual underlying timecodes attached to the steno\nor paragraphs independently from the offset, you can uncheck this option in the \"edit\ntimecodes\" dialog.\nVISUALIZERS:\nE6 - Dashes Hyphens\nG1 - Numbers Overview\nI2 - Edit Timecodes\nE1 - Paragraphs\nM11 - Auto-Magic Punctuation\nA7 - Hyperkeys\nE9 - Spellcheck\nM12_Auto-Magic_Numbers\n13.23.1 Transpose (Flipping) words\nTranspose/flip words\nSingle-stroke: Ctrl+R/hyperkey Shift+R\nor Edit/Miscellaneous/Word flip\nTo transpose two words (change âdog theâ to âthe dogâ) use the\nTranspose/Flip words command (Ctrl+R).

(To access this tab, click the Display\nproperties toolbar button or Alt+U/Display.) Because print commands are\nnonprinting page elements, this feature disables the display of text boxes. Print\ncommands also become visible when you use the arrow keys to scroll through a\ndocument and the cursor moves into a print command field (when the cursor is\nmoved off the field, the command is hidden).\nResume Elements\n366 Eclipse Help\nAllows you to resume something that has previously been omitted with an Omit\nprint command. The Additional Info box works the same as it does for Omit\ncommands. See steps 4-6 above.\nNew Paragraph Number\nIf you have enabled paragraph numbering on the Advanced Paragraph Data\ndialog, this command will assign a number to the next numbered paragraph in the\ntranscript. Paragraph numbers will increment from there. Commonly used to number\nQuestions.\nComment\nA comment line does not perform a task; rather, it is a place where you can\ninsert a notation or other text message. For example, if you are a scopist, you might\nuse comment lines to leave a message for your client after you return the file.\nComment lines do not print, nor will they appear in an ASCII file (which is true\nof all print commands).\nIndex Command\nInserts an index line, which is used in generating an automatic index . See\nthe page on indexing for more information on how index lines are constructed.\nAttachments\nGo to any point in your document, open the Insert Print command dialog and\nclick on Attachment. Select any file from the file dialog that opens, and it will be\nattached to the document in the current position. You can use this to embed exhibit\nfiles directly into your pdf transcript. You can also embed .jpg [ictures, .txt ASCII\nfiles, audio files, video files, etc.\nThere is an ATTACHMENT=etc. File location that remembers where you browsed\nto when you attached a file. Attachments are not required to be in that location. This\nsimply makes the process of attaching multiple files from the same place more\nconvenient.\nYou can review that the attachment works by placing your cursor in the\nattachment print command and hitting [enter]. That should open the file just as a\nuser would see it.\nWhen you create the PDF, these attached files will appear in a separate\nattachments pane (the paperclip icon in Adobe Reader) and can be accessed directly\nthat way.\nYou will also get a \"Contents\" bookmark group above the index which will list\neach of the files. Each file will have sub-bookmarks: One to open the file, and another\nclickable link describing the page and line number in the document where it appears\nthat can jump right to it.\n450\n987\n564\nEditing A Transcript 367\nOn the page where the attachment appears, a clickable hotspot rectangle will\nappear to the left of the line number where the attachment was added in the\ndocument. This hotspot will also open the attachment. So, using the attachments\npane, the \"open file\" bookmark, and the clickable hotspot, clients using the PDF will\nbe able to open the attachments.\nPage Number Format\nChanges the appearance of the page number. See Page Number Format for a\ndescription of how page number formatting codes work.\nNew Volume Number\nAssigns a volume number to the transcript. If you want to include volume\nnumbers in the index , or print only specific volume numbers , you will need to\ninsert this command to assign a volume number. (If you do not assign a number, the\nvolume number is assumed to be 1.)\nScript Command\nFor use in captioning , and in creating lessons .\nGraphic\nThis does not insert a physical print command, but rather, opens a dialog where\nyou can inserts a graphic into the transcript. You can use this to include a signature or\na seal on a title page, for example.\nWhen you select the Graphic print command, the Insert graphic link dialog will\nappear:\nClick the Browse button to select the graphic you wish to insert. The file\ndialog will appear, from which you may select any image type. After selecting the\nimage, its path will appear in the Image text box.

Left and Top control positioning, relative to the top and\nleft edges of the paper. Size will resize the object proportionally. Stretch will stretch\nor squash the image vertically.\nThe slider, number text box, and spin controls control the size of the\nmeasurement you selected with the option buttons. Experiment with these numbers\nto adjust the position and size of the image as needed.\nWhen you are happy with the placement of the image, click OK.\nBecause it is a print command which can span many lines, after you insert an\nimage, it will not be visible on the screen while print commands are visible, just as\nwith a transcript box.\nPrint command display is temporarily disabled when the graphics dialog is on\nthe screen.\nAlso, keep in mind that the image will be drawn exactly at the moment that the\nsoftware draws the print command, which has two consequences:\n1. If you place the graphic command on the page BELOW where you are going to\nmove the image (by moving the top edge up) the image will be drawn AFTER the\ntext, and will therefore be drawn OVER the text. If you insert the print command in\nthe document ABOVE where you are going to place the image, the image will be\ndrawn BEFORE the text below it, and will therefore be drawn UNDER the text.\n2. If you place one or more graphic commands at the END of a header or footer,\nit will appear on EVERY page when the header or footer is drawn. This will allow you to\nadd fancy letterhead or transcript boxes.\nNote that if you want text and graphics on the same page to get out of each\nother's way, you are responsible for arranging them yourself. You can change the\nmargins of the text any way that is necessary to move it out of the way of the\ngraphic.\nThere is no limit to the number of graphics commands you can add to a\ntranscript.\nNote: the graphics do NOT get added to the document. These are graphic\nLINKS, and if you need to move the document with the graphics to another computer,\nyou will need to move the graphics files, also.

Note that these autogenerated\nimages work exactly like other print command images; you can reposition\nand re-size them to put them anywhere on the page, including in\nthe margin.\nIf you look at the content of a graphic print command containing a QR\ncode, you will notice that it looks like like an image path, except that it starts\nwith the \">\" character, indicating a code instead of an image. Note that this\nmeans you can design complex codes that contain form fields that are filled\nin during editing with information such as the date or job name.\nThese codes appear on the screen and on the printout, so they can be\nscanned from either the printed page, or directly from your screen.\n370 Eclipse Help\nThe purpose of a QR code is to give a person in a physical space a direct\nlink to a URL on the Internet without them having to type a website address,\nor without having to send them an e-mail with a link in it.\nFor example, if you are at a deposition and you want to give the\nattorney a rough copy of the transcript, you could e-mail them a link and\nhave them click a link, or you could say \"point your phone camera at this\nbox\" and <beep> they have the transcript.\nTo hook them up to Bridge Mobile, you could tell them to go to\nconnect.eclipsecat.com, or you could e-mail them a link, or you could say\n\"point your phone camera at this box\" and <beep> they're on the Bridge\nMobile page.\nPaper transcripts could be delivered with QR code links to digital\nversions.

When you press\nEnter or click OK to close the dialog, that character will appear at the cursor position.\nFor example, to enter the surname NuÃ±ez, you would type \"Nu\"; press Ctrl+W to\nopen the Special characters dialog; select the Ã± character; press Enter, and then\ntype the rest of the name.\nYou can hit the Font button select the font you wish to see the special character\nfor. This is especially helpful if you wish to see if something like the Symbol font has\nthe special character you need.\nNote that this does NOT cause the font in the document to change to that font\ntype. This is because the special character dialog can be used in the document and in\ndialogs, and each different usage for this dialog may require a different mechanism\nfor changing fonts, or may not supports fonts at all. For example, when globaling, or\nin a dictionary it might be necessary to use {F:Symbol,13}D{n} in addition to just\ntyping the D to get the delta symbol. In a document, it's necessary block mark the\ncharacter, select Format/Font and select Symbol.\nEditing A Transcript 377\n1. Customizing unicode character mappings\nIf you need a character that is not on the list, you can select any of the\ncharacters on the list that you don't ever use and wish to replace with something else,\nthen hit the \"reassign\" button in order to select any available 16-bit unicode\ncharacter.\nThis will bring up a full unicode chart starting with page 0 (the default page,\ncontaining the characters you are familiar with.) You can browse through the pages to\nfind what you're looking for, though with 208 pages that could take a while. Then\nagain, the majority of later pages are a handful of Eastern pictographic languages that\nrequire large numbers of characters that you are unlikely to need.\nIf you know what unicode character you need, you can type the hexadecimal\ncodes directly into the \"Char\" edit box. While this might sound techie, the reality is\nthat a Google search gives you an instant answer to any character you might want, as\nlong as you know what it's called. For example, if I search for \"sigma character\nunicode\" Google tells me it's U+03A3. That means I can just type (or copy/paste)\n03A3 into the \"Char\" box in the Eclipse dialog and it will jump right there and it will\nalso advance the page to that location (hint: It's on page 3! Each page has 256\ncharacters.)\nAs a reminder, these characters will only appear in situations and file types that\nwe have some influence over. They will work in printing, PDF output, the CART\nwindow, and any output type that can accept UTF-8 encoding. CaseView cannot. Plain\nASCII cannot (though plain Text files can. It's a grey area.) And there's no guarantee\nthat if someone wants to import a file with these extended characters that it will work\nin their software, so check your use-case before relying on these characters in order to\nget the accents right on an unusual name or mathematical symbol.\nVISUALIZERS:\nvE7_Accents\nDÃ©finir_ou_Corriger\n378 Eclipse Help\n13.24.5 Insert Lockspace\nInsert Lockspace\n~ (Shift+`)\nEdit/Insert/Lock-space\nThe Edit menu/Insert/Lock-space option inserts a lockspace into a\ntext file.\nThe lockspace will look like a regular space, unless print commands are\nvisible .

When doing\nCART or captioning, it is standard to use ALL CAPS. However, words with\nnon-standard capitalization, such as surnames and company names, should\nappear with lower-case letters to show the capitalization. To accomplish this\nin a script, insert literal case commands around any text you want to appear\nexactly as formatted in the script.\nFor example, if a script contains the following line:\n362\n1058\n666 1052\n694\n666 1052\nEditing A Transcript 379\nYou could force the \"ac\" of MacDonald to always appear lower case, by\nmarking those two letters, and inserting a Literal Case command (via the\nmenu, or by pressing Shift+Ctrl+C). An all-caps output would read \"ON\nMacDONALD AVENUE.\" Without the literal case commands, it would read \"ON\nMACDONALD AVENUE.\"\nLiteral case commands are invisible in the text file. However, if you\nplace your cursor at the point where a section of literal text begins or ends,\nthe status bar will show {Literal Case ON} or {Literal Case OFF} at the\nbottom left.\nLiteral Case and Dictionary Entries\nThe above steps pertain only to text files that are used as scripts. You\ncan also insert literal case commands into dictionary entries.\nTo do this, use {l1} to turn Literal Case on, and {l0} to turn it off. That\nis a lower-case L, followed by a one or zero, in braces. For example, if the\ndictionary entry is for the word MacDonald and you want the AC to be lower\ncase, the dictionary entry syntax would be: M{l1}ac{l0}Donald\nYou can also force lowercasing using \"downcap\" dictionary entries. This\nturns on literal mode, and turns on and off, or toggles lower case. Use {d1}\nto turn downcap on, {d0} to turn it off, and {dt} to toggle.\n13.25 Check Spelling\nCheck Spelling\nShift+Alt+S (spell check a document)\nAlt+S (spell check a single word)\nor Production/Check spelling\nRELATES TO: Spell Check Options .\nBegins a spell check.

For example, you could be filling in a form field on your\nappearance page and you need to type an address. You take a wild stab at the\nspelling of \"Shukill\" and it comes up underlined, indicating a misspelling. You hit\nCtrl+F, scan down past the spell dictionary items to the Google suggestions, which\nhas \"Schuylkill\" among them. Pick it and hit Change and continue filling in the form.\n414\nEditing A Transcript 387\nThe Purge ignored words button will delete all words that have been\npreviously ignored via the Ignore or Ignore All options on the Spell Check dialog\n.\nThe Error categories area allows you to determine which types of grammarchecking\nwill be performed when you run a spell check. If a category is checked, the\nspell checker will stop if that type of error is encountered. Your options are\nMisspelled Words, Double Words, Punctuation, Double Q (two consecutive\ninstances of the Question paragraph style), Double A, Double Speaker and Check\nnon-transcribed text (If you turn this last feature on, the system will check all\nspelling, punctuation and double word errors everywhere in the document, even in\nfixed lines, caption box paragraphs, print commands such as comment\nlines/headers/footers, and other non-transcribed text in the document).\nWatchWords\nSee Visualizer\nThe WatchWords feature allows you to specify certain words that the\nspellchecker will highlight, and always stop on, even if they are spelled correctlyl. This\nis useful if your transcript has two words that are similar, and you want to manually\nverify that each instance is correct.\nWatchwords have two features: First, the spell check will always stop on them.\nSecond, once you have run the spell check even briefly, at least once, the watchwords\nwill appear with the warning red underline on the editing screen just as misspelled\nwords are.\n(Note that there is a list of Watchwords in User\nsettings/Programming/Watchwords which are also correctly spelled words, that\nwill be underlined in blue when you have turned on Proofreading . Unlike the Spell\ncheck watchwords, these warning underlinings will disappear as soon as you cursor\nover them.)\nTo create a list of watchwords:\n1. Open the Job variables dialog. (The default speed key is Shift+Alt+V.)\n2. In the Job variables dialog, type the word WATCH, in all caps, followed by\nan equals sign.\n3. After the equals sign, type a list of the words you want to watch for,\nseparated by commas. The Job variables dialog will now look something like\nthis:\n381 379\n389\n414\n1006\n388 Eclipse Help\n4. Close the Job variables dialog.\n5. When you begin a Spell Check , the spell checker will automatically stop on\neach instance of all words that you entered in Step three. Also, they will be\nunderlined in red (you must also be in WYSIWYG mode ).\nNote that the above directions will add watchwords for just the current job. To\nadd words to the watch list permanently, go to User\nsettings/Programming/Spelling Exceptions and add words, which will be added\nto the watchwords list for each job. They will appear in the Job Variables as\nWATCH=word1,word2,word3,etc.\nTo add these words to the spelling exceptions to have permanent watchwords,\nuse the ! symbol before them:\n!accept\n!except\n379\n123\nEditing A Transcript 389\nVISUALIZERS:\nE9_Spellcheck.mp4\nE9_Watchwords.mp4\nE9a_List_Errors.mp4\nI6_e-Book_Proofreading.mp4\nI6_Bridge_Mobile_Proofreading.mp4\n13.25.2 List Errors\nList Errors\nCtrl+Shift+E\nProduction/List errors\nThe Production menu/List errors option is an alternate method of\nchecking spelling and grammar. With a transcript open, invoking this\ncommand will open the List errors dialog:\n390 Eclipse Help\nIf any errors are detected, they will be listed in alphabetical order. If\nthe same error appears more than once, each instance beyond the first one\nwill have a numeric designation [0002], [0003], etc.\nGrammatical errors appear at the bottom of the list, and are preceded\nby the letters \"zz\".\nIf you have marked a block first, it will only list the errors in that block.\nThe List errors dialog works similarly to the Spelling Alternates\ndialog . The buttons at left will impact the selected error from the list at\nright:\nÂ· Ignore will ignore all instances of this error.\nÂ· Change opens a text box where you can type a corrected version of\nthis word. (For grammar corrections, it is best to use the Suggest\noption below.)\nÂ· Change all opens a text box where you can type a corrected version\nfor all instances of this word.\nÂ· Add will add the word to your User Spelling Dictionary.\nÂ· Delete will delete the word.\nÂ· Suggest will open the Spelling Alternates dialog , where you can\nselect from a number of proposed spellings, or from a list of grammar\ncorrections if it is a grammar error.\nÂ· Definition will give a dictionary definition of the word.\nÂ· Global will initiate a global of the word's underlying steno.\nWhen you are finished making corrections, press Escape to close the\nerror list.\nYou can also move the list errors dialog to the side, click on the text\nand do some editing, and then go back to the list errors dialog and continue\nreviewing the list of errors. You will not need to re-run the entire list errors\nfunction and re-generate the list if you need to make an editing change in\nthe middle of the review process.\n13.25.3 AutoMagic and Spelling\nAutoMagic: Spelling\nRELATES TO: AutoMagic , Typeover tracking .\nAutoMagic will offer a number of spelling-related choices while editing.\n380\n380\n326\n52 884\nEditing A Transcript 391\nIt may offer to flip the order of 2 words, such as \"you do\" and \"do you\" in the\nexample below. In this same example, note also alternative spellings for the word\n\"do.\"\nIt may offer to change the suffix of a word; in this example, \"dates\" should have\nbeen \"date\" and AutoMagic recognizes that and offers to change it.\nAutoMagic will recognize compound words, and suggest the option of changing\nthem to 2 words, such as the compound word \"outstanding\" which should have been\n\"out standing.\"\nIn this example, AutoMAgic has noted that in the case of \"tool\" and\n\"technological\" typeover tracking was used previously to change one to the other,\nbecause the steno for the two words is very similar. So AutoMagic offers to make that\nchange with one keystroke.\n392 Eclipse Help\nIn addition to recognizing a possible misspelling, AutoMagic may also offer to\nput dashes between the letters of the word \"Lafayete\" to indicate it was spelled out in\ncourt.\n13.26 Block Operations\nBlock Operations\nsee below for keystrokes\nRELATES TO: Block mark .\nBlock operations are a way to copy or transfer large sections of a file. They work\non all three file types. To perform most block operations, you must first mark the\nblock you want to work with. After marking a block, Automagic will display some\ncommon options.\nBlock Read (Alt+R)\nInserts a copy of another file into the current file at the cursor location.\nAfter you press Alt+R, a file dialog will appear. Select the file you wish to\ninsert into the current file.\nThis command is commonly used to insert block files into a transcript. It can\nalso be used to merge two files of the same type, such as two separate note files.\n394\n394\n396\n969\n548\nEditing A Transcript 393\nUnlike other block operations, Block Read does not require you to mark anything\nfirst. Simply place the cursor at the location where you want the selected file to be\ninserted, press Alt+R, and select the file. (When merging dictionaries, the cursor\nlocation does not matter.)\nWhen merging text files or note files, the file that is read in will be inserted at\nthe cursor location. Be sure that the cursor is in the correct location before beginning\nthe block read.\nYou can select multiple files to be inserted at one time.\nIf there is a paragraph type in the file being read in that is not in the document\nyou are adding it to, the missing paragraph type will be added to the current\ndocument so the block/read will work correctly. If, however, the paragraph type does\nalready exist in the current document, and the margins for that paragraph are\ndifferent from those in the file, the current document's settings for that paragraph will\nbe used, not the settings in the file being read in.\nIf you are reading in a transcript that contains steno tracking, the tracking will\nbe copied over as well (allowing you to perform globals on that section).\nIf you are using Block Read to merge dictionaries, it is advisable to have Detect\nConflicts checked on the Edit tab . If the same steno exists in both dictionaries,\nyou will be asked which entry you wish to keep. You also have the option to create a\nconflict of the two entries. If you merge dictionaries without using Detect Conflicts,\nthe dictionary that is being brought in will take precedence.\nYou may also unmerge dictionaries by using the unglobal command.\nBlock Write (Alt+W)\nCopies the marked text into a separate file.\nAfter marking a block, press Alt+W. A file dialog will appear. Select the file\nyou wish to copy this block into. You may also copy the marked block into a new file\nby entering a new filename, just as when creating a new file .\nWhen you block write a text file or note file into an existing file, it will be\nappended (added to the end) of that file. If you want to insert the file at a specific\nlocation, use Block Read instead.\nWhen doing a Block Write, it does not matter if the target file is open or not.\nBlock Separate (Ctrl+Shift+X)\nBlock Separate works just like Block Write , except that it deletes the marked\nblock from the current file. If you have selected a large block, you will be asked to\nconfirm that you wish to delete it.\nCut, Copy, and Paste\nIn addition to the Eclipse-specific Block Read and Block Write functions, you\nmay also use the standard Cut (Ctrl+X), Copy (Ctrl+C), and Paste (Ctrl+V)\ncommands on marked text.\nCut will delete the marked block, and send it to the Clipboard, where it can be\npasted somewhere else.\n326\n309 306\n338\n394\n969\n1036\n392\n393\n394 Eclipse Help\nCopy will copy the marked block, and send it to the Clipboard, where it can be\npasted somewhere else.\nPaste will insert a previously cut or copied block of text at the cursor location.\nCut, Copy, and Paste are not limited to Eclipse: you may use these commands\nto transfer text to/from any Windows program.\nRedact text and audio simultaneously - If you need to deliver audio with\nportions redacted, you can redact both the text and audio for portions of your\nmanuscript. Mark the block of text to be redacted, open the Control Panel (Audio\nplayback controls - Ctrl+Shift+A) and select Redact. For more on redacting audio,\nsee Working with audio.\nVISUALIZERS:\nE1 - Cut/Copy/Paste\nF7 - Autoincludes\nvF8 - SplitMerge\nE1b - Block Functions\nvF9 - Quoted Testimony Speedkeys\nvF9 - Redacted Text\nvD4e - Audio Redaction\nM10 - Auto-Magic Blocks\n13.26.1 Block Mark\nBlock Mark\nF7/hyperkey M\nor Block/Mark..\nRELATES TO: Block Move .\nThe Block Mark command selects text, so that an action can be performed on\nit.\nTo select text, press F7 or hyperkey M, and then use any of the basic cursor\nmovements to select the exact text you want. Alternatively, you may use the block\nmove commands, which mark and move at the same time.\nMarked text appears in an inversed color scheme:\n649\n397\n312\n397\nEditing A Transcript 395\nThe cursor is half the height of the marked text. That shows you the cursor\nposition, from which further cursor movements will take effect.\nIf you move the cursor in the direction of text that is already marked, it will unmark\nit. Using the above graphic as an example, if you move the cursor to the left, it\nwill start un-marking words from the end of the marked phrase.\nTo mark additional prior text, use the Block menu, Mark back option.\nTo cancel all marking, press Escape .\nEditing Marked Text\nSee Visualizer\nOnce text is marked, a great many editing functions can be performed on it:\nÂ· You can delete the entire block by pressing the Delete key. If it is a large\nblock, you will be asked to confirm.\nÂ· Block operations .\nÂ· Single- and double-spacing .\nÂ· In a text file, you can perform several punctuation commands:\no Stitching. Pressing the hyphen or period key will stitch a marked phrase, or\na single word, with that character. For example, if you mark \"SMITH\" and\npress the hyphen key, you will get S.M.I.T.H. If you mark \"matter of fact\"\nand press the hyphen key, you will get \"matter-of-fact.\" Pressing the hyphen\nor period again will remove the stitching.\no Removing spaces. Marking a phrase and pressing the space bar will remove\nspaces from the phrase.\no Surrounding a phrase with commas or quotation marks. After marking a\nphrase, press the desired punctuation mark.\nBlock Marking in Dictionaries and Note Files\nYou may also block mark sections of note files . This is most useful for\nsplitting or combining note files via block operations .\nYou may also mark dictionary entries, for purposes of copying/transferring them\ninto a different dictionary via block operations . However, the dictionary filter is a\nmore powerful tool for isolating the specific entries you want. So if you want to copy\nsome dictionary entries to another dictionary, you will filter the dictionary and then\nblock mark all of the filtered entries for transfer.\n319\n396\n392\n1055\n224\n392\n392 197\n396 Eclipse Help\nVISUALIZERS:\nE1b - Block Functions\nM10 - Auto-Magic Blocks\n13.26.2 AutoMagic in Marked Blocks of Text\nAutoMagic in Marked Blocks of Text\nRELATES TO: AutoMagic , Info bar .\nWhen you have a block of text marked, AutoMagic immediately offers to mark\nmore text, or more previous text (see choices 9 and 0 in example below).\nOnce your text is marked, AutoMagic provides several options.\nÂ· You can Copy the marked block.\nÂ· You can Google the word or phrase, which opens your browser and lets you\nsearch without having to copy and paste.\nÂ· You can change Attributes such as adding boldface or italics.\nÂ· You can surround the marked text with punctuation such as quote marks, or\ndashes, or brackets.\n52 998\n1060\nEditing A Transcript 397\nÂ· If you are in Realtime, have the Auto-brief feature turned on, and you block\nmark a piece of text, an AutoMagic item will appear for creating a brief on the\nfly for the marked text.\n13.26.3 Block Move\nBlock Move\nsee below for keystrokes\nRELATES TO: Block Mark .\nThese commands offer alternative ways to mark large blocks of text.\nInstead of executing a block mark and then using basic cursor movements\nto select what you want, you may use any of the following keystrokes to\nmark and select at the same time.\nThere are no hyperkeys for any of these actions.

Placing the cursor on the\nunderscored text will show the specific error in the status bar and also above\nthe AutoMagic choices. It can find everything from missing punctuation and\nnon-matched open/close quotes/parens to suspicious grammar such as \"were\ntalk.\"\nYou can select a different color for errors by going to User\nsettings/Display/Colors and selecting Proofreader error from the Color\nselections drop-down list.\nYou can ignore a proofreading error by simply hitting the Escape key\nwith the cursor anywhere in the highlighted area. For example. the\nproofreader flagged this construction, because normally the I is a pronoun\nthat would not follow the, or be attached to a number. But in this case it\nrefers to an Interstate, and is correct; so when you hit Escape, the blue line\ngoes away, and it will no longer flag it as an error.\nEditing A Transcript 415\nNote that the \"watchwords\" specialty marks - proofreader entries with\nno description - are automatically cleared as you pass the cursor by them,\nsince they're not technically errors.\nIf there are errors you know you never want to see again, you can\ndelete the rule or rules from the list found in User\nsettings/Programming/Proofreading rules. Simply highlight the entry\nand press Delete.\nIf you type a double word such as Pago Pago, you can hit Escape once,\nand all other instances of that specific double word will be ignored for the\nrest of the document. Other double words such as \"was was\" or \"to to\" will\nstill be flagged. This is much faster than adding a special exception to the\nrule globally, and will allow job-specific items to be temporarily ignored.\nYou can scan to proofreading marks by using the\nMove/Scan/Any/Proofreading highlights function, though the most\nefficient way to use it is to simply review the marks in-place as you edit.\nIf you put the cursor on an error and go to User\nsettings/Programming/Proofreader, you can easily find the rule the\ncursor is on by using the \"Find\" button, which will be pre-loaded with the\nrule in question.\nError found\nProofreading rule\n416 Eclipse Help\nAutoMagic suggestions for proofreading errors\nAt the end of a proofreader rule, you can use {a} to add a suggestion.\nYou can add as many as you like. For example, an error such as \"Mismatched\nverb=he do\" could be written as\nMismatched verb=he do{a}he does{a}I do\nand it would show \"he does\" and \"I do\" as suggestions in the AutoMagic\nfeature in both the infobar and pop-up windows. Also note that you can use\nmacro syntax: {a}M:Flip words and instead of offering a specific piece of\ntext, it will run the proofreading-specific macro with the specified name, such\nas \"Proofreader:Flip words\"\nErrors that include a conflict\nIf an error contains a conflict, proofreader still shows on infobar and will\nshow on status bar if your cursor is within the error but not on the conflict.\nThe conflict choice will take precedence over the proofreader.\nSpecial error tags\nThe proofreader includes special tags for paragraph-based structural\nerrors that are technically not part of the text, but which require the\nproofreader to look at several paragraphs to make a determination that\nthere's a problem.\nIn order to make it possible to detect these, it adds some text to the\nbeginning of the proofread paragraph content text. Just before the paragraph\ndesignation which looks like <<Q>> it will add >> plus a 4-letter error code\nas follows:\n>>NOBY â Indicates a missing by line\n>>DBLQ â Double question.\n>>DBLA â Double answer\n>>DBLS â Double speaker (with the same name)\n>>MTPG â Empty page (caused by a page break/new page command\nafter a blank line at the end of a form page that has just barely stretched\nover to a new page. Easy to miss, and really annoying when printing or\ncreating a PDF and proofreading it.)\n>>BLNK â Any blank paragraph type with testimony above and below\n(not Fixed/Centered/etc.) is likely to be an error and will have this tag.\nProofreading rules can easily be added to the existing list just by\nadding these codes, like so:\nDouble Question=>>DBLQ\nbecause when the proofreader sees that this sequence of text is\npresent, it knows that there's an error.\nEditing A Transcript 417\n\"Under the Hood\" Information for Advanced Users:\nIn order for the proofreader to work, it must have a set of rules defined\nunder User settings/Programming/Proofreading rules. These rules are\nwhat make it all work.\nThere is a separate list under User\nsettings/Programming/Watchwords that is used by the proofreader to\ncall your attention, briefly, to words that often require a second look to make\nsure they're really the word you wanted. You can also add a watch phrase to\nthe list and it will work exactly as a watchword does.\nAlso, the default proofreading rules contain a special code that will\nmark any punctuation error that would be flagged as invalid punctuation by\nthe spelling checker, which follows the exceptions specified in the User\nsettings/Programming/Spelling exceptions.\nIf your proofreading rules are empty, the load user function will load\nnot only the default proofreading rules created by Keith Vincent, but will also\npre-load a series of specialized suffixes and macros designed specifically for\nthe proofreader's AutoMagic feature described above. If you have used a\nprevious version of the software and wish to use the new rules, remove all of\nthe previous proofreading rules and re-load your user to trigger the\nautomatic import.\nDetails on how to edit the rules is found in the Reference Guide page on\nAutomatic Proofreading Rules.\nVISUALIZERS:\nvE9 - The Automated Proofreader (and Auto-Magic)\nvE9 - The Automated Proofreader in Action\n13.29 Bridge Mobile Proofreading\nBridge Mobile Proofreading\nWhen you have finished editing a transcript, it is ready for Proofreading.\nYou can do your proofreading on any mobile device running Bridge Mobile\nPro , and get it back in Eclipse with just a few keystrokes. After entering\nemail, and password information in Eclipse and Bridge Mobile, you simply\nconvert your document (to another system), open it in Bridge Mobile, put in\nyour proofreading notes and comments, and convert it (from another\nsystem) and all your notes and comments will be there, in the appropriate\nplaces in the transcript.\n720\n1207\n418 Eclipse Help\nSetup In Eclipse:\nFirst, you will need to go to the Connection Magic settings dialog,\nand enter the e-mail and password you want to use for your Bridge Mobile\ncloud document service.\nTo do this, go to User settings/User/Advanced and click the\nConnection Magic button at the bottom of the dialog.\nEnter your email address and password. Click OK. You will get a\nmessage that it is necessary for Eclipse to restart. Click OK, and after waiting\na few seconds, reopen Eclipse.\nSetup In Bridge Mobile:\nIn order to link up Bridge Mobile and Eclipse, it's necessary to enter the\nsame e-mail and password in Bridge Mobile that you just entered in Eclipse.\nOnce you have set up a Bridge Mobile cloud user, it will remember your email\naddress, and you can store Bridge Mobile documents permanently.\nEditing A Transcript 419\nFor details on setting up and using Bridge Mobile, see Bridge Mobile:\nConnection and Use and Additional settings and options .

Click the Check mark. You will get a message instructing you to\ncheck your email for verification. Click on the link in the email.\nHow to Proofread a job in Bridge Mobile\nOnce the above setup is complete, go to Tools/Convert/To another\nsystem/Text files/Bridge Mobile proofreading. Select a file (or files),\nand click Next and Finish. This will convert the document and transmit it to\nthe cloud file server.\nThen go to Bridge Mobile and open the transcripts dialog (the Folder\nicon). Under âunfiledâ the document exported from Eclipse will appear.\nYou can go through the document looking for errors and mark them\nusing either quick marks or issue codes. Since issue codes are userdefinable,\nyou could use issue codes such as âspellingâ or âpunctuationâ or\netc. You can also write notes.\nNote: For details on issue codes and notes in Bridge Mobile, see Bridge\nMobile: Connection and Use .\nAfter proofreading, close the document.\n1227 1220\n1227\n420 Eclipse Help\nBack in Eclipse, go to Tools/Convert/From another system/Text\nfiles/Bridge Mobile proofreading and select the file. The original file will\nopen, and will all of the issue codes and notes have been turned into\ncomment lines at the appropriate points in the document. These comment\nlines will include page/line references, the issue code, and the notes.\nNote: For the notes and comments to be visible, you must turn on\nPrint commands in User settings/Display.\nAlso, remember not to make changes in your transcript in Eclipse until\nyou have brought the proofread version back into Eclipse. That will avoid the\nproblem of page and line numbers changing, and will keep your comments in\nthe right spots.\n13.30 eBook Proofreading\neBook Proofreading\nRELATES TO: Tools/Convert ,\nIf you have a Kindle or other eBook reader that uses the MOBI file format, you\ncan use it to proofread your documents. To set up Eclipse, plug in your e-book reader\nand find the folder where it stores documents using Windows explorer. then in User\nsettings/Programming/File locations, add EBOOK=etc. to point to that path. (For\ndetails, see File Locations .\nFor example, if your Kindle is G:\\documents, you will add the following:\nEBOOK=G:\\documents\n948\n839\nEditing A Transcript 421\nThen, when you want to proofread documents, with your Reader connected ...\n...go to Tools/Convert/To another system/Text files/e-book\nproofreading.

On a Kindle, you can\nmove the cursor through the document and mark text.\nAnd/or you can start typing on the keyboard to make a note to yourself\nEditing A Transcript 423\nWhen finished proofreading, reconnect the reader and use\nTools/Convert/From another system/Text files/e-book proofreading. Select\nthe .mbp files for the jobs that you've proofread and hit Next.\nHaving done that, when you re-open the documents in Eclipse you'll find that\neach mark has turned to \"Scopist text\" color, which you can scan to using the\nMove/Scan function.\nAlso, anywhere you wrote a note, you'll have the text color change and the note\nwill appear at the top of the paragraph inside a comment line.\nNote made on the ebook while proofing appear as comments in the Eclipse transcript.\n424 Eclipse Help\nIMPORTANT: Once you have done the Tools/Convert/to/e-book, don't make\nany changes in the document in Eclipse before you re-import the marks and notes or\nthey might not end up in the right places.\n13.31 pdf Proofreading\npdf Proofreading\nRELATES TO: Tools/Convert ,\nUnder Tools/Convert/From another system/Text files, there is an\noption for PDF proofreading.\n1. Create a PDF file, using Production/output to pdf.\n2. Open it in any PDF reader that allows annotations, such as Adobe\nReader.\n3. The two types of annotations supported are highlighting and notes.\nUse the highlight function to highlight a single word by doubleclicking.\nUse the \"note\" function to place a note at a specific location\nin the PDF and type a comment into it.\n4. Save it (with the same name).\n5. Run Tools/Convert/From another system/Text files, and select\nPDF proofreading. Select the file you proofread.\n948\nEditing A Transcript 425\n6. When you import the PDF proofreading information, the highlights\nwill be converted to a searchable text type in the document, and the\nnotes will be converted to comment lines.\n7. You will see that after you run the conversion, the first choice in\nAutomagic is to re-open the text file.\n13.32 Edit Mode\nEdit Mode\nThe \"Edit Mode\" feature has been added to Edit Toggles. It allows you\nto edit any document entirely from the writer, in or out of translation, using a\ntechnique of writing corrections into a pop-up text box and then applying\nthem with single-stroke quick replacement macros. If you are transcribing\nwith Boost/Flow enabled when you toggle into edit mode, it will immediately\nallow the speech engine to take over transcribing and the steno machine is\nrepurposed for edits.\nThe Status bar shows an Edit Mode indicator, EDT.\nUtilizing Edit mode works the same way that translation does in most\ninstances. Conflict selection, number conversion, capitalization\nVISUALIZERS:\n13.32.1 Edit Mode Best Practices\nEdit Mode Best Practices\n426 Eclipse Help\nEdit Mode Best Practices\n{M:Edit Here - RT}\nThis switches into edit mode. MANY edits should be performed now by\nswitching into edit mode first and then preparing the edit and applying it.\nThat includes globals, insertions, deletions, corrections, etc.\nThe editmode \"big picture\" is this: Prepare text by dictating into the\neditmode box, THEN hit a macro telling the system \"do something with this\ntext.\" By contrast, remember that the punctuation/paragraphing macros are\n\"one-shots\" which immediately insert or change a punctuation at the cursor\nposition, since these are very common edits that shouldn't require you to hit\na \"do this\" stroke after writing the stroke. If you have already written text\ninto the box, all of the punctuation macros first INSERT the text, then add\nthe punctuation to the end of it. Further refinement for\ncapitalization/spacing/etc. when paragraph/punctuation macros are used in\neditmode are definitely possible, and quite easy, just by adjusting the plugin\ncode.\nAmong the more useful of the editmode macros are the {M:Fix Next -\nED} macro, which allows you to write \"badword goodword\" and then hit the\nmacro to have it search forward and replace one word with another in just a\nfew strokes, and {M:Fix Text Between Words - ED} which allows you to write\nquite a large amount of text as a long phrase and it matches the first AND\nlast words in the phrase you write to words appearing in the text following\nthe cursor, replacing everything in between with what you've written.\nTo get OUT of edit mode, use:\n{M:Panic Stroke - RT}\nwhich is the traditional macro for closing all open dialogs, unmarking\nblocks, turning off modes, going to the bottom of the document and following\nalong with the writer in realtime. No need for a new macro. This is just the\n\"I'm ready to resume writing again\" macro, and always has been.\n{M:Go Edit Untran - RT}\nThis is a variation on \"edit here\" that first scans backwards to an\nuntran, saving a stroke. It does now go into EDIT mode, not keymode or\ncorrection mode. It also does NOT open the globaling window.\nWhen you have the cursor on a word or untranslate, and you're in edit\nmode, you just write the replacement NORMALLY exactly as you would do\nduring writing. If you can write it with prefixes and suffixes, great.\nFingerspelling also works, just using your normal glue entries. The idea is\nthat you should compose the text in the editmode box by writing exactly as\nyou would into a transcript.\nNormally, a global in edit mode will simply change the item your cursor\nis on. If you need to collect more words/strokes, use\nEditing A Transcript 427\n{M:Block Plus Right - ED}\n{M:Block Minus Right - ED}\n{M:Block Plus Left - ED}\n{M:Block Minus Left - ED}\nto create or expand the marked block to include more text in the global.\nAgain, this is not the global dialog. It's just marking a block.\nThen when you're ready to apply the global, hit one of the following:\n{M:Global Job Capped - ED} -- globals it as a capped version of what you've\nentered into the editmode box.\n{M:Global Job Speaker - ED} -- globals it as a speaker version of what\nyou've entered (Mr. Jones becomes {S:MR. JONES})\n{M:Global Job - ED} -- globals into the job dictionary\n{M:Global Local - ED} -- does a local replacement\n{M:Global Main - ED} -- puts the global into the main dictionary\nAlternatively, the following macros can global a specific number of words. It's fewer\nstrokes, but more thinking. It may be easier just to hit Block Plus Right - ED a few\ntimes until the text is highlighted, then use one of the above macros. Testers we\nworked with found the above items more intuitive than the \"XWords\" macros.\n{M:Edit Global 1 Word - ED}\n{M:Edit Global 2 Words - ED}\n{M:Edit Global 3 Words - ED}\n{M:Edit Global 4 Words - ED}\n{M:Edit Global 5 Words - ED}\nAdding an entry from scratch:\n{M:Add Dictionary Entry - RT}\nThis does not use keymode or correction mode. Instead, it now uses a\nfeature in the plugin api to open the steno dialog and SPECIFICALLY ask it for\nstrokes from the writer, instead of from the computer keyboard.\nWhen you use this macro, you will first see the steno dialog. The steno\ndialog now has text boxes below the OK and Cancel buttons that are used to\nspecify the steno strokes used to accept or cancel the dialog. -RBGS for OK\nand #* for cancel are the defaults, and since these only matter inside the\ndialog, they don't conflict with anything. Feel free to customize these.\n428 Eclipse Help\nAfter writing the steno, it will go into editmode, and will show a display\nprefix, such as:\nTPHAOU EPB TRAOE =\nat which point, you can begin writing the replacement normally, exactly\nas described in the globaling process above. Once again, this does not use\nthe global dialog. Just compose the text as you would write, then use one of\nthese macros:\n{M:Global Job Capped - ED}\n{M:Global Job Speaker - ED}\n{M:Global Job - ED}\n{M:Global Local - ED}\n{M:Global Main - ED}\nThese macros are smart enough to understand that if there's an entry\nprefix with STENO = text, it is making an entry from scratch, not globaling\nthe text the cursor is sitting on, so you don't need a whole bunch of different\nmacros to add entries from scratch. Fewer is better. Much of this is similar to\nthe old realtime editing kit, just using editmode instead of keymode or\ncorrection mode.\nThe default editmode macro set had a few additional items added to it,\nsuch as a \"Fix Previous - ED\" to go along with the \"Fix Next - ED\" macro in\ncase you want to write \"badword goodword\" fix and have it go backwards\ninstead of forwards. There is also a \"Find Reverse - ED\" in addition to the\n\"Find - ED\". Edit mode works just as well for occasionally jumping backwards\nto perform edits in realtime as it will for editing forward in text that is already\nwaiting.\nVISUALIZERS:\n13.32.2 Edit Mode Macros\nEdit Mode Macros\nEditing A Transcript 429\nThe default Edit Mode plugin macros are named to be consistent with\nthe existing realtime macro names, including spaces and a standard suffix.

These changes are stored in your User Settings , and will not\naffect any existing text files .\nIf Current Document is checked, any changes you make will affect the\nactive text file only. (You can only choose the Current Document radio\nbutton if a text document is active when you access the Paragraph or\nDocument tab.)\nThis setup allows you to control the scope of your changes. If you need\nto change margins for a particular job only, you may do so without impacting\nany other jobs.\n434\n447\n434\n447\n434 447\n99\n694\nFormatting Transcripts 433\nCopying Master to Current or Current to Master\nYou can copy settings from Master Format to Current Document, or\nvice versa. This will change one to match the other.\nFor example, you may have an old job that needs to adhere to a new\nset of margin/paragraphing standards. When you open the file , however, it\nwill retain its Current Document settings that it had when you created it. You\ncan copy from Master to Current to change the document settings to match\nwhat's in your Master Format.\nYou can also copy from Current to Master. This will change your Master\nFormat settings to match those of the current job. This is useful if you have\nperfected your settings, and want all future documents to have the same\nformat as this one. (When manipulating margins/paragraphs for the current\ndoucment, it is useful to set the display to WYSIWYG mode .)\nCopying Current to Master normally ignores fonts and paragraph labels,\nsince every speaker name in a job is a paragraph label, and every single font\nchange, even to just a few characters, gets added to the document. Most of\nthese will not be used in future documents, so copying them to the master\nformat makes no sense. However, if a paragraph label or a font is used as the\ndefault font or the default label for a paragraph on the list, then that label or\nfont is copied over to the master settings since the paragraph setting is a\nstrong indication that that font or label will be used in future documents.\nTo perform a copy:\n1. Select the format you want to copy from. The arrow on the Copy button\nwill change, to indicate the direction of the copy. (In the above graphic,\nyou would be copying from Master to Current.)\n2. Click Copy.\n3. A warning message will appear: âWarning: The current document will\nbe changed to reflect the master document settings. Any changes you\nhave made to the settings in the current document will be lost.\nContinue?â If you're sure, click Yes. (This message will not appear if\nyou have disabled it.) If you are copying from the Current to Master\ndocument, the warning will read \"Warning: Your master document\nformat will be changed...\".\nIt is usually a good idea to apply the settings to the current document\nbefore copying them to the Master format. That way you can make sure that\nyou have all the settings the way you want them before applying them to the\nMaster format.\nNote that when you click-and-drag the ruler controls on a text\ndocument, you are changing the current documentâs formats.\n86\n96\n962\n434 Eclipse Help\n14.2 Document Tab\nDocument Tab\nThe Document tab contains general options for the printing and appearance of\nyour transcripts.

The graphic below this list box\nis a representation of the margin you have chosen.\n432\n432\n469\nFormatting Transcripts 435\nÂ· To use inches, select Inches from the inches/centimeters list box at center, and\nenter the desired number of inches into the text box to the right of the\ninches/centimeters list box.\nÂ· To use centimeters, select Centimeters from the inches/centimeters list box at\ncenter, and enter the desired number of centimeters into the text box to the right\nof the inches/centimeters list box.\nÂ· To use twips, enter the desired number of twips into the text box to the right of\nthe word \"Twips.\" Twips are used for very subtle changes: there are 1440 twips\nto an inch.\nYou do not have to change the margin in terms of both twips and\ninches/centimeters. You need only work in the measurement you want to use; the\nother will be changed automatically. For example, if you change a measurement from\n1.0 inches to 0.5 inches, the twips text box will automatically change from 1440 to\n720.\nThe Text box button opens the Text Box Setup dialog, in which you can set\nup a box that appears around the text of the transcript.\nThe Timecodes button opens the Timecode Setup dialog, in which you can\nset up timecodes, and other time-related options.

Absolute timecodes\nrepresent the time of day; Relative timecodes start with 0 at the beginning of the\ndocument (though this starting point can be changed with the Starting Timecode\noption).\nThere are four components to a timecode: hours, minutes, seconds, and frames.\nThere are 30 frames per second.

This is necessary because the timecode offset and wav ms/sec settings could\ntheoretically be required to be different for different .wav files if they were recorded\non different devices. For example, a backup audio .mp3 recorder could have been\nstarted at a different time from the original .wav file, and it could \"drift\" away from\nthe original PC recording by a small percentage.\nYou may want a document's RELATIVE timecodes to start at a particular time,\nexactly 00:01:00:00 for example, instead of 21 seconds or 15 minutes or however\nmuch time has elapsed since the beginning of the job. You can press the Auto\nbutton, and enter the desired target timecode: 00:01:00:00, for example, and the TC\noffset will automatically be set to the difference between the two, and all the\ntimecodes in the document will follow from that first one. If you have a need to adjust\nonly a portion of the document, you can block-mark the document and use\nEdit/Misc/Edit timecodes, and that dialog also has \"auto\" buttons next to both the\nrelative and absolute timecode rows. Hit the button, type in your desired STARTING\ntimecode and hit [enter] and the offset will be calculated automatically and applied to\nall of the timecodes in the marked block.\nStarting Timecode is the point from which relative timecodes are calculated.\nThe default is 00:00:00:00.\nTimecode Offset is an offset that is applied to every timecode in the transcript.\nIt is the amount of time added to or subtracted from each timecode in the document\nwherever the timecode is used. It is used globally to correct timecodes that are off for\nsome reason. The default is -00:00:03:00, which accounts for the natural delay\nbetween the deponent speaking and the word appearing in the transcript.\nTimecode Offset can be used to synchronize timecodes with a video tape, or with\nany external source. Simply determine the variance between the times, and set the\nTimecode Offset to that amount. If the deposition is five seconds behind the video,\nset this to 00:00:05:00. If the deposition is five seconds ahead, set it to -\n00:00:05:00. A minus sign means you are winding the clock backwards; an offset of -\n00:00:05:00 would change 9:00 AM to 8:59:55 AM.\nIf you use any functions to insert timecodes while editing or translating so that\nthe timecode appears as text typed directly into the document, the timecode offset\nwill be applied to the timecode being inserted in order to make it match the dynamic\ntimecodes being displayed.\nSync to cursor is used when you have a WAV file recorded on an external\nsource. In this case, the timecodes are usually self-consistent, but not aligned with\nthe document's timecodes. If you can hit \"play\" and hear the audio and you can\nidentify where the audio is playing, you can synchronize the file with this button. Go\nto User settings/Document/Timecodes. When you hear the word the cursor is on,\nhit the Pause or Stop button, and hit the Sync to cursor button, and it calculates a\nnew offset for you automatically. The audio will now be synchronized at the cursor\nposition.\n438 Eclipse Help\nWhen you use the \"sync to cursor\" function in the document in one location, it\nsets the offset. If you then go to a different location (at least ten minutes away) and\nuse the \"sync to cursor\" function again, the software now has two data points to look\nat, and it will calculate the ms/sec proportion automatically. You can repeat this\nprocess multiple times if you like; each time it is only looking at the last two\nmeasurements, and measurements farther away from each other will produce more\naccurate results.\nFF/RW - the Fast forward and Rewind functions will advance the playback\nposition by the number of seconds indicated. Note that FF/RW only work while you are\nplaying, or when the playback is paused. At any other time, they do nothing, because\nif you are stopped, the playback will always start at the cursor position.\nTimecode Calculator button - allows you to type in two timecodes and either\nadd them together or subtract them. Used when necessary to make an adjustment to\nthe timecode offset or the starting timecode based on some existing information in\nthe document. For example, if you hit play in a document at timecode 1:46:15:23\nand what you hear is the text that appears later in the document at 2:08:12:15, you\ncan fix it by adjusting the timecode offset by the difference between those two\ntimecodes. The timecode calculator can tell you that the difference is 00:21:56:22.\nThe Copy button in the calculator lets you copy the result and paste it directly\nwhere you need it.\nWAV ms/sec is the length of a second. Leave it at the default setting of 1000.\nPrinting\nThe Time Printing area affects whether or not timecodes appear, and how they\nlook.\nAbsolute timecodes show the time of day when the transcript was recorded.\nRelative timecodes, which are used primarily for audio and video\nsynchronization, start at 0 and advance incrementally. If the recording is paused, the\nâtimerâ also stops. You can choose to use absolute or relative timecodes, or both.\nSelect 12-hour or 24-hour mode. Timecodes set in 12-hour mode take more\nroom than do those in the 24-hour mode because AM or PM must be added to the\ntimes.\nFormatting Transcripts 439\nThe Size option for timecodes is set according to the number of elements (not\ncharacters) that you want the time to use. For example, to show the hours and\nminutes, you would set the timecode size to 2 (hours + minutes) and to show hours,\nminutes, and seconds, you would set the timecode size to 3.\nTo activate timecodes, select the desired frequency from the Time printing\ndrop-down list:\nÂ· None.

Make your choices from\nthe font dialog .\nPositioning Timecodes\nWhen you insert timecodes into a document format that did not have them\nbefore, it is likely you will have to do some rearranging. The following items in the\nDocument Margins are relevant:\nÂ· Timecode Margin Set this to determine the position of your timecodes.\nÂ· Left Margin/Line Number Margin If you are positioning your timecodes on the\nleft, you will likely have to increase one of these to prevent the timecodes from\nrunning over the text.\nÂ· Paragraphs tab /Right Margin.

Would you state your name for the record?\nAnswer:\nAn answer paragraph is the beginning paragraph in a series of paragraphs,\nwhich are an answer to a question. If a paragraph is set to behave as an\nanswer paragraph, it will have the following characteristics.\nÂ· The first word of the paragraph is\nautomatically capitalized.\nÂ· The paragraph gives and receives automatic\npunctuation. It adds a question mark to the\nprevious paragraph, while receiving a period\nas terminal punctuation.\nÂ· If necessary, the paragraph will be changed to\nColloquy according to the âChange Answer to\n_________â feature rules.\nÂ· Two paragraphs in a row that are set to\nbehave as answer paragraphs will result in a\nDouble-Answer error in spell check.\nÂ· The label color for the paragraph is\ndetermined by the color settings for âAnswer\nParagraph Labelsâ.\nÂ· Multi-page fonts are applied to the paragraph.\nThe following paragraph is an example of an Answer paragraph:\nA.

The Default Label: text tells you which label is currently selected.\nTo assign a different label, select it from the list of labels at right.\nTo assign a label that is not in the list, you can either click Change\nLabel to change the existing label to what you want, or click Add Label to\nadd a new label to the list. You will be prompted to type the new label.\nNote: entering a new label will not automatically assign it to the\nparagraph style. After creating it, make sure you select it before exiting this\ndialog.\nYou can also delete a label from the list by selecting it, and then clicking\nDelete Label.\nText types for Paragraph labels\nEclipse records a text type for each paragraph label, which allows it to\nbehave exactly like a text type for the body text of the paragraph.\nInserting any type of paragraph manually using functions such as F3 for\nQuestions, F4 for Answers or F2 for speakers will cause that paragraph label\nto appear in the appropriate typed-in-text color (typed for reporters, scopist\ncolor for the edit station, or user 1 - user 8 if selected.)\nFor existing or translated paragraphs, if you block mark a sequence of\ntext and use the Format/Text type function, and that text includes a\nparagraph label, that label will acquire the selected text type. This also works\nif you place the cursor on the paragraph label by hitting home twice and use\nFormat/Text type.\nYou can also set the text type by using the Paragraph bar button, or by\nhitting Home twice, then hit F8. The Paragraph data dialog opens. Hit the\nText type button to open the Pick one: dialog where you can change the\nlabel's text type.\n464 Eclipse Help\nPutting the cursor on a paragraph label and hitting the text properties\nfunction will show the description of the text type just as it would for regular\ntext.\nIf a paragraph label (such as a Q, A or Speaker name) is set to a text\ntype other than \"translated\" it will show up on the screen in the text type\ncolor. Otherwise, it will show up in the Q/A/Speaker paragraph label color.\nYou can set a paragraph label to a text type that is relevant for printing\nor ASCII. For example, if you set a paragraph label to redacted type, it will\nappear with the substitution character such as XXX or the black bar.\nA paragraph inside a conflict such as \\{S:MR. EUFPLT}\\{&I} will show\nup as conflict text type both in translation and when selecting the conflict in\nediting.\nThe scan forward/backward commands such as Ctrl+T will stop on\nparagraph labels if they're set to appropriate text types, such as untranslate,\nconflict, or if scanning to scopist text and the scopist has manually inserted a\nparagraph.\n14.5 By Line Formats\nBy Line Formats\nRELATES TO: Edit Tab of User Settings .\nDuring translation, by-lines are automatically generated when a Q symbol is\nadjacent to a speaker identification. The By line formats dialog allows you to change\nthe appearance and behavior of by-lines. To open the dialog, go to User\nsettings/Edit and click the \"By\" formats button.\n306\nFormatting Transcripts 465\nThere are two sets of by-line formats available: Speaker+Question and\nQuestion+Speaker. This allows you to have two different looks for your by-line in the\nsame transcript, by writing the speakername and the Q symbol in a different order.\nHowever, most people just use the Speaker+Question by-line.\nThe Template box dictates the text of the by-format itself. The code {C will\ninsert the speaker name in ALL CAPS. {M will insert it in mixed case. Any other text\nwill appear as is.\nThe Samples button will open a dialog with the most common by format\ntemplates that are used. You can choose one from the list, or use the examples for\nguidance and inspiration to create or customize your own.\n466 Eclipse Help\nThe Question Text On Same Line checkbox will keep the question on the same\nline as the by-line template. Uncheck this for by-lines in the previous example, where\nthe \"BY MR. SMITH\" is on the first line and the question is on the second. (Note: for\nQuestion+Speaker by-lines, this must be checked. For Speaker+Question by-lines, it\nis optional.)\nWriting {S:MR. SMITH}{Q} will produce the following results:\nTemplate Question Text On Same\nLine\nResult\nBY {C: Off BY MR. SMITH:\nQ. What?\nBY {M: Off BY Mr. Smith:\nQ. What?\nQ. (By {C:) On Q. (ByMR. SMITH) What?\nQ. (By {M:) On Q. (ByMr. Smith) What?\nAny other arrangement is possible, by typing the desired text of your by-line,\nand placing {M or {C where the speaker's name would go.\nOther Options\nThe Same Page check box will keep multi-line bylines on the same page, by\nautomatically inserting a conditional page break above each one. This is useful if\nyou are not using the Question Text On Same Page option.\n363\nFormatting Transcripts 467\nThe Paragraph Format drop down list allows you to select the style of the\nparagraph that is generated when a by-line is formed. It is recommended that you\nleave these items at their default settings of By line (SQ) for Speaker+Question bylines,\nand By line (QS) for Question+Speaker by-lines.\nBy the way, if you want to change indenting, wrapping, and other paragraphing\nbehaviors of a by-line, just change the settings for that paragraph style on the\nParagraphs tab .\nAnswer By-Lines will produce by-lines anytime there is an Answer adjacent to a\nspeaker name. Answer by-lines will behave the same as regular by-lines; the only\ndifference is that A will appear instead of Q.\nSetting page breaks with speaker labels\nIn User settings/Edit/âByâ formats, you can choose either the Question\ntext on same line or Same page checkbox.\nIf you want the text of the by line paragraph to begin on the same line as the by\nline, mark the Question text on same line checkbox.\nTo keep the By line and text on the same page, mark the Same page\ncheckbox.\nInserting By-Lines During Editing\nThe by-line templates are applied during translation, any time you write a\nspeaker ID followed by a {Q}, or vice versa. You may also insert a by-line during\nediting, with one caveat: the Q or speaker name must already be present, and there\nmust be some other text in the paragraph.\nFor example, if you have this:\nYou can convert this to a by-line by inserting a speaker ID (via F2, as usual) right\nbefore the Q symbol. To do this, move the cursor to the end of the previous paragraph\nbefore inserting the speaker. Since the speaker ID precedes the Q, it would follow\nyour rules for a Speaker+Question by-line.\nIf you have a standard colloquy paragraph and wish to convert it to a by-line,\nthis can be done by inserting a Q symbol (via F3) at the very beginning of the\nparagraph text:\n447\n468 Eclipse Help\nIf there is no existing text, inserting a speaker name next to a Q will not produce\na by-line.\nIf you are not using the Question Text on Same Line option, you may also\nmanually insert a by-line by using the Insert New Paragraph (F8) command.\nSelect \"By-Line (SQ)\" from this list of paragraph styles. You will be asked to select\nthe speaker's name ; this will generate the by-line. You may then insert the Q\nsymbol as usual (with F3).\nChanging The Speaker's Name\nIf a by-line has an incorrect speakername, you can change it the same way you\nchange regular speaker IDs, via the Speaker dialog .\nBy-Line Dictionary Entries\nBy-lines do not require special dictionary entries. You need only write one of your\nexisting speaker IDs, adjacent to a {Q} symbol, to generate one.\nAutomatically resume by-line insertion\nAn option under User settings/Translate will automatically Insert missing\nBY lines. Here's how it works:\nAs long as you write the first by-whom indication {S:MR. SMITH}{Q}, for\nexample, from that point forward, any {Q} that is written that doesn't follow an\nanswer or answer paragraph will automatically have a by format applied to it.\nNote that it will default to using the QS by format, typically defined as âQ (By\nMr. Smith)â but if you would prefer that it use the SQ by format, simply remove the\nQS by format template from the settings under User settings/Edit/âByâ formats.\nAutomatic BY format always applies after a speaker or parenthetical is written no\nmatter what other paragraphs intervene. For example, if you have:\nQ. Did you?\nMR. SMITH: Objection.\nTHE COURT: Overruled. Go ahead and answer\nA. Yes, I did.\nQ. And when did you?\nthere should be a BY format associated with the second question.\nA parenthetical always triggers BY lines and answer to witness features. For\nexample, if you have a question, then an answer, and then a parenthetical paragraph,\nif you then write a question the system will automatically put a BY line before it (if\nyou have the automatic by line feature turned on.) If you write a question, then an\nanswer, then a parenthetical statement, if you then write an answer it will change to\nTHE WITNESS or whatever you have entered into the setting under User\nsettings/Translation.\n344\n249\n253\n244\nFormatting Transcripts 469\nVISUALIZERS:\nE4b - By-Lines\nC4 - Paragraph Behavior\nE4bb - InsertMissing By-Lines\n14.6 Document Margins\nList of Document\nMargins\nRELATES TO: Document tab .\nIn the top left-hand corner of the Document settings area on the\nDocument tab , there is a list of document margins that can be changed.\nHere is a list of each margin, and what it affects:\nÂ· Page Length - Length of the printed page.

If there is too much space\nat the bottom of the page, increase this number. If there is not enough\nspace, or if text is running off the page, decrease it.\nÂ· Character Spacing - The horizontal space between characters. The\ndefault setting of 144 twips (.1 inch) will give you 10 characters per\ninch.\nÂ· Left Print Margin - Distance between left edge of page and line\nnumbers.\nÂ· Line Number Margin - Distance between line numbers and text.\n434\n434\n470 Eclipse Help\nÂ· Page Number Row - Distance between top edge of page and page\nnumber.

Headers and\nfooters can be inserted multiple ways, and you have options available for each.\nHeaders\nHeaders can be inserted into a transcript via a Print Command (Alt+N) or by\ninserting a new paragraph (F8) . Either action will insert a Header command into\nthe transcript. A space will open up in your document, and an âH,â for âHeader,â will\nappear as the paragraph format for the new paragraph. Type the text of your desired\nheader into the command.\nIf you are in WYSIWYG mode when you insert the print command, you will be\ntaken out of it to enter the header text.\nWhen you insert a header into a transcript, that header will be in effect from the\npage the command is on, through the end of the document. This allows you to have\nmultiple headers within a document (if your header is the name of the deponent, for\nexample). Unless the Header print command is placed at the top of the page, the\nheader will not begin printing until the next page.\n436\n441\n362\n434 610\n362\n344\nFormatting Transcripts 471\nYou will be able to see the header above Line 1 in the Eclipse display, unless you\nhave Page Boundaries set to None or Compact. When placing your headers for the\nfirst time, you may wish to use WYSIWYG mode , which will allow you to see the\nactual margins on your computer screen.\nTo insert a multi-line header, use the New Paragraph (Ctrl+P) command. A\nsecond header command will appear. Type the header into it as you did the first line.\nPlacement of the header on the printed page is controlled on the Document\ntab , from the list of document margins at top left. The settings relating to\nheaders are Top Margin (distance between top of the page and the header) and\nHeader Margin (distance between header and Line 1).\nTo remove a header from part of a transcript (such as the title pages), you can\ninsert a header with no text in it, or use an Omit print command .\nTo edit an existing header command, search for it , and then edit it as desired.\nYou can also delete an existing header command by using Delete Line (Ctrl+Y) .\nIf you want your header to appear on Line 1, go to Advanced Document\nSettings , and set Numbered Header Lines to 1. If you use a Numbered Header\nLine, you must make one additional setting on the Document tab to ensure proper\nspacing. Go to the list of document margins , and set Header Margin to twice the\nvalue you are using for Line Height.\nIf you want a two-line header to occupy Line 1 and Line 2, set Numbered\nHeader Lines to 2, and insert a two-line header . Numbered Header Lines of 3 or\nmore are also possible.\nYou can control the behavior of headers in a multi-page printout , in the Multi-\nPage Print Dialog .\nPutting the current speaker name in the header\nYou can use {C or {M in the header (just like BY formatting.) The last speaker\nname seen will be inserted in place of those characters.\nNote that these header commands are inserted as part of the printing/display\nroutines, but the alignment calculations are based on there being only two characters\nthere, so they may throw off centered headers by a few characters. You can adjust for\nthis by padding the header on the right side with a few spaces to help even it out.\nPutting the current timecode in the header\nPutting {T in the header (no closing brace) will insert the current timecode in\nthe header in place of those two characters.\nPutting page, line and/or volume numbers in the header\nPutting {P {L and {V in the header or footer (no closing brace) will insert the\ncurrent page, line and/or volume number in place of those two characters. Note that\nthe page number row and column in the user settings should be used in most\ncircumstances, while this method is for those rare instances when you wish to have\nthe page number in multiple locations on the page.\n129\n123\n349\n434 434\n365\n321\n319\n440\n434\n434\n471\n605\n615\n472 Eclipse Help\nFooters\nFooters work the same as headers in all respects, with the following exceptions:\nThe Document tab of User settings offers a Default Footer box, where you\ncan enter a default footer. If you enter a default footer in your Master Format , this\nfooter will be used in all documents, unless you insert a footer via F8 or a print\ncommand. This allows you to have a default footer (such as the name and address of\nyour reporting agency), and override it with a different footer if necessary. The default\nfooter uses the Footer paragraph format, which can be changed in User\nSettings/Paragraphs tab. The vertical position of the footer on the page can be\nadjusted by selecting Footer margin in the User Settings/Document/Document\nsettings drop-down list.\nYou can override the default footer by using the Footer print command.\nThe distance between the last numbered line and the footer is controlled by the\nFooter Margin setting in the list of document margins on the Document tab .\nThere is no explicit setting for the distance between the footer and the bottom of\nthe page, like there is for the distance between the header and the top of the page\n(Top Margin). The distance between the footer and the bottom of the page is what's\nleft over after the Top Margin, Header Margin, and Line Height have been applied.\nNumbered Lines (the number of lines per page) is also a factor. If you have too\nmuch or too little white space at the bottom of your page, you need to make changes\nto some of these items, especially Line Height. All these margin settings can be\nfound on the Document tab .\nIf you are in WYSIWYG mode when you insert the print command, you will be\ntaken out of it to enter the Footer text.\nVISUALIZERS:\nB6 - Footers\nB6a - Footer Adjustments\n14.8 Volume numbers\nVolume numbers\nIf the job is more than one volume, specify the start of a new volume with\nthe New Volume Number print command.\nGo to Insert Print Command (Alt+N).\nSelect Volume Number from the list.\nIn the Value field, enter the number you want to assign the volume.\n434\n432\n434 434\n434\nFormatting Transcripts 473\n14.9 Fonts\nWorking With FONTS\nThere are many ways to change font styles in Eclipse. Be sure to use the method\nthat best reflects the change you wish to make.\nYou can change the font for the entire document, or for only a text selection. In\nboth cases, you will use the Font dialog (Ctrl+Shift+F).\nIf you just want to change the font to make it easier to read on the display, you\ncan go to the Display tab of User Settings and click the Editing Font button. This\nchange will affect the display only.\nTo change the font used for printing the transcript, go to the Document tab\nand click Main Font. This will change the transcript's primary font; if you print it, it\nwill be in the font you chose. Any bold faced, italicized, or underlined text will be\nchanged to the new font as well.\nIf you want to temporarily change fonts in a dictionary entry -- such as to\nitalicize the name of a newspaper -- there are a variety of font commands that can do\nthis. See the page on Dictionary Entry Syntax for a full list of font commands and\nhow they work.\nWhen editing a transcript, if you want to change some text to a different font,\nmark the text , and then use the Format Font command. Any change you make\nwill apply to the marked text only.\nFor minor font changes in a document, such as to bold-face, italicize, or\nsuperscript/subscript something, you can use the text attributes dialog.\nYou can also assign fonts to different paragraph types . For example, you\nmake your questions appears in bold face, and your answers in regular text. To do\nthis, go to the User settings/Paragraphs tab , select the paragraph format to work\nwith, click Advanced to go to the Advanced Paragraph Data dialog, and then click\nMain Font or Label Font. Choose a typestyle for the paragraph using the standard Font\ndialog. Click OK to accept the options and return to the Paragraph tab. Then click OK\nagain to save the format.\nYou can change the appearance of dictionaries and note files by right-clicking\nthe file, and selecting Font from the menu. You will be taken to the font dialog ,\nwhere you can choose the desired font, attributes, and size for the file type you are\nworking with. This change will affect all files of that type, within the current user.\nSetting the font for an entire document\nTo set the font for your document,\n122\n434\n958\n394 982\n1060\n445\n447\n450\n980\n474 Eclipse Help\n1.

Click OK to have your selections take effect. Click Cancel to disregard the\nselections and return to the document window.\nIf you put the cursor on the beginning of a word in a different font and start\ntyping, what you type will be in the same font as the word. If you place the cursor\nimmediately AFTER the word, it will be in the font that appears after the word.\nSelecting a Font Size\n394\nFormatting Transcripts 475\nType size is the height of a font measured in points (72 points = one inch).\nBecause some letters, such as âf,â have parts that go above a midpoint (called\nascenders) and others, such as âg,â have parts that go below the line (called\ndescenders), height is measured from the bottom of a descender to the top of an\nascender (in other words, the height is greater than the height of a capital letter).\nText intended to be read on a printed page is typically 10 to 12 points. If you have\nselected a scalable font, such as TrueType or Adobe Type 1, you can enter a number\nfor the size even if it does not appear on the type size list. If the font is not scalable,\nyou must select one of the values on the type size list. To choose the font to use for\ndocuments, the best thing to do is to set the font in your User\nSettings/Document/Main font. This setting will cover 99.99% of your work.\nSubscripts and Superscripts\nIn any of the font dialogs, sub- and superscripts are indicated by the vertical\noffset field in the bottom left corner of the dialog. You can either type a number in the\nfield, or use the arrows to scroll the numbers up and down. Normal text will be set to\n0; superscripts are indicated by positive numbers and subscripts by negative\nnumbers. The measurement is in twips, which represents a twentieth of a point (72\npoints = 1 inch). For example, you can set a superscript of an 8 or 10 point font to\n100 and a subscript to â80. (Note that small fonts donât need to move down as far as\nthey need to move up to achieve a similar effect.\nFor example, the 2 in H2O has no offset, but is already 80 twips shorter that the\nH & O.\nIn H2O it has an offset of -80 twips; in H2O it has an offset of 100 twips.)\nSetting the character width\nAll fixed-space fonts in a document will conform to the width (in twips) specified\nby the character spacing setting in User Settings/Document. It defaults to 144 (1440\ntwips per inch / 144 = 10 characters per inch). To set the character spacing for a\ndocument, go to the User Settings/Document tab/Document settings drop-down\nmenu (the menu usually shows Page width by default). After selecting Character\nsettings, set the width that you want in the twips field on the right side of the dialog.\nCharacter spacing does not affect proportional fonts, so any stylistic proportional\nformatting in your documents will be unaffected.\nImportant noteâIf you use multiple fixed-space font sizes in your document,\nthey will all have the same pitch, regardless of their size.\nEvery character in fixed-space fonts will adhere to these measurements exactly.\nThis feature can actually compress letters closer together than the Windows\ndefault for that font, and can be used when increasing font size to keep letters\nequidistant.\nSetting font for a paragraph format\nTo set the font and typestyle for paragraph formats:\n1.

Then click OK\nagain to save the format.\nSetting fonts for special parts of paragraphs\nTo set the font for paragraph labels, speaker names, etc., you will need to edit\nthe paragraph format. The basic method for doing that is given below. When you edit\nthe paragraph format, the change takes effect for all paragraphs using that format,\nnot just the current paragraph. Note that if you are editing a document created with\nan earlier version of Eclipse, you might need to retranslate to have the change take\neffect on all paragraphs of that format.\nSetting fonts for individual paragraph labels\nTo change one instance of a paragraph label (perhaps for a particular speaker),\n1. Select the paragraph label either by moving the cursor to the first line of the\nparagraph and pressing Home twice, or by clicking the paragraph label.\n2. Open the font dialog (Ctrl+Shift+F).\n3. Select the font and/or font characteristics you want. Click OK.\nNote that the label will be changed for only the paragraph from which the\ncommand was issued.\nSetting font for one paragraph\nTo change the font for a paragraph, place the cursor anywhere in the paragraph\n(without marking a block), and then press Ctrl+Shift+F for the Font dialog. Select\nthe font you want, and then click OK. The change is applied to the entire paragraph,\nincluding the text that is before the cursor as well as what follows it.\nStriking out and underlining\nTo indicate text to be deleted, use the strikeout style. It put a line through the\ntext, similar to what you would do if you were editing on paper and crossed\nsomething out.\nThe underline places a single continuous line under the text. The line continues\nbetween words.\nSetting text colors for printing\nKeep in mind that the color of text on your monitor is not necessarily the color\nthat it will print. To set the color for printed text, open the Font dialog and click on\nthe Color drop down menu. Select a color from the list. The text on your screen will\nnot reflect this color change.\nFormatting Transcripts 477\nSetting text for confidentiality\nThe program will omit text from the output for ascii, pdf files, and output to\nBridge if the text type is set to redacted.

When you select a box\ntype from the list, the preview window on the left displays the boxâs general\nappearance, allowing you to see left and right margin borders, and horizontal borders\nabove and below both headers and footers. This will give you an idea what the box\nwill look like relative to text in a transcript.\nAlternatively, you can create a starting box by clicking the L, R, T, H, F, and B\nbuttons that surround the graphic. Clicking one of these buttons will cycle through\none line, two lines, and no line in that position. This allows you to create custom\nboxes.\nTo customize a standard design, begin by selecting single, double, or no lines for\neach border. For example, you may want a text box that only surrounds text (a short\nbox), but which has a double line along the bottom. The buttons that appear around\nthe preview area allow you to make this selection. The buttons are adjacent to the\nborder they control and are labeled L (left rule), R (right rule), T (top rule), H (header\nrule), F (footer rule), and B (bottom rule). Each time a button is selected, its\ncorresponding border is switched among single, double and no line.\nAfter leaving the Text box setup, you will to be able to edit the box directly\nfrom the document window by clicking-and-dragging to change the boxâs borders and\nusing a right-click menu to change the line thickness.\nWhen you have completed your selections for the default box, click OK.

This is a nine-pin port that\nyour writer physically plugs into.\nIf your computer does not have a COM port, you will need to produce one, by\npurchasing a USB-to-serial adapter. This device costs about $50. It plugs into a USB\nport, and has a COM port on the other end; your writer will plug into that. To install\nthis device, follow the instructions that come with it.\nAlternatively, you may use a PCMCIA card. This device is more expensive,\nhowever, and can only be used if your computer has available card slots (which most\ndesktop computers do not).\nWhether you have a built-in COM port, or if you purchased an external device to\ngenerate one, Eclipse needs to know the COM port number.

You need only click the toolbar button, or select it from the\nmenu, and a realtime job will begin. (There is also a keystroke, the + key on\nthe number pad, but this feature is designed with the mouse in mind. Click\nonce, and realtime begins.)\nWhen you start a realtime job with Instant Realtime, you will not have\nthe opportunity to confirm or change settings on the Translate Notes\ndialog, or on the Input tab or Realtime tab of User settings. Your\nexisting settings will be used.\nBy default, the job will automatically be given a name like this:\nRT071606-1836. That is the letters \"RT\", followed by the date and time the\njob was begun (July 16, 2006 at 6:36 PM). If you want to give the job a\nmore meaningful name, check Auto-Rename Realtime Job on the\nRealtime tab of User settings, and you will be prompted to name the\nrealtime job after you stop translation.\nAlso, the Filename item on the Realtime Tab allows you to\nspecify a different default name. Because the realtime filename can use any\nof the time/date template commands the Realtime filename template item\nis a droplist with sample templates. Also on the droplist is a date/time help\nitem that will immediately bring up the help page with the list of all of the\ntemplates and what they mean.\n483\n483\n269\n226 487\n489\n300\n489 487\nRealtime 487\nNote that in order for the \"auto-rename realtime jobs\" feature to work,\nthe filename must start with RT and the third character must be a digit,\nwhich is why the templates are all set up with RT immediately followed by\none of the day/month/year items in digit format.

See the page on Output\nFormats for a description of these items.\nFlush Delay is the amount of time the program will wait before translating\nyour last strokes if you stop writing. The flush delay never comes into play unless you\nstop writing long enough for it to expire. The Flush delay allows Eclipse time to\nconsider multi-stroke entries.\nIf you are attempting to write a two-stroke outline, you must write the second\nstroke within this amount of time, or Eclipse will consider them to be two separate\none-stroke entries. This is measured in milliseconds: the default setting of 2000 is\nequivalent to two seconds. If multi-stroke words are translating as individual words,\nincrease this setting.\n519\n520\n523\nRealtime 489\nIf you never stop writing long enough to allow the flush delay to expire, it will\nnever be applicable. The flush delay being set very high can't hamper your translation\nquality, but if you set the flush delay too low, your multi-stroke outlines might not be\ntranslated correctly.\nIf you are a new writer and write slowly, increasing the flush delay may improve\nyour translation.\nPending Translation Display has to do with the Flush Delay. If Pending\nTranslation Display is checked, any translated steno that is being held by the Flush\nDelay will appear, in its dictionary syntax form, before the translation is applied. For\nexample, if a question stroke is being held by the Flush Delay, you will briefly see the\n{Q} text. The Pending translation text appears in untranslate color, but does not use\nthe untranslate background color, so be sure your untranslate foreground/background\ncolor is visible in comparison with the normal text color and the page background that\nyou're using. (You can adjust them in User settings/Display tab/Color\nselections .)\nIf Follow Always is checked, the cursor will automatically jump to the bottom of\nthe realtime job whenever a new stroke is entered. If you want to have a scopist\nediting at your computer while you are writing in realtime, you must turn this off. You\ncan always force the cursor to follow by using a Bottom of Text\n(Ctrl+PageDown) command.\nIf Stop Follow on Unresolved is checked, the cursor will stop on any\nuntranslate, unresolved conflict, or blank field. This makes it easier for you to edit\nyour own realtime job during breaks; you don't have to reverse scan for things\nthat need to be fixed.\nHide Cursor When Following will, as the name implies, make the cursor\ninvisible when you are using the Follow Always feature. This is useful for CART, where\nyou want the text to follow, but don't want the cursor to be visible.\nAuto-Rename Realtime Jobs has to do with the Instant Realtime feature.\nIf checked, you will have the opportunity to assign a meaningful name to any jobs\nyou create with Instant Realtime. When you stop translation , you will be asked to\nenter the desired name. All files of the job will be renamed. (If Auto-Rename Realtime\nJobs is not checked, the job will simply keep the default name .)\nAlternatively, you can use the The Filename text box to specify a default\nfilename for Instant Realtime transcripts. You can insert regular text and/or time\nand date codes into this text box to create a new format for default filenames.\nThis allows you to create a desirable default name for Instant Realtime jobs, instead\nof having to autorename them each time.\nDivision Interval allows a scopist to edit the job in realtime via a network. If\nthis is set to a number of a minutes above 0, a copy of the job will be saved that\noften, in the Network folder . Each file will have a time appended: if the job is\ncalled JONES, it would create files called JONES_1000.ECL, JONES_1015.ECL,\nJONES_1030.ECL, etc., in the Network folder. (This will likely create filenames of more\nthan 8 characters; make sure your network can accept them.) A scopist with access to\nthe network could scope these files individually and then use the Block Read\n(Alt+R) command to put them back together.\n125\n313\n340\n486\n300\n486\n486\n374\n906\n392\n490 Eclipse Help\nWhile this is normally set to a number of minutes, you can also break off a\nsection immediately using Tools/Realtime/Force division. This will cause the\ndivision interval to split and write out, and a new one will start immediately.\nYou can use this not only with regular intervals, but you can also use manual\nintervals entirely by setting the interval time to an arbitrarily large number such as\n99999 minutes, and then only using the \"Force division\" function to break off\ndivisions.\nThe Division Interval field is a job-sharing feature. For more details, see\n\"Working with a Scopist .\"\nEdit Buffer is a way to delay realtime output. If set to a number of words above\n0, Eclipse will hold on that number of words before outputting them; this gives you an\nopportunity to perform any edit on the word before it is sent. The buffer can also bet\nset to a time using the \"ms\" field, which is the number of milliseconds to stay behind\nthe cursor (to a maximum of 60000, which is a full minute.)\nThis allows you to stream content in a way that is timed exactly as it was\noriginally written, but gives an editor a period of time to edit the material before it is\ntransmitted. If a broadcaster is willing to put the broadcast on a time delay, this\nmeans that the text can theoretically be edited to perfection, and timed to appear\nexactly when spoken, even with input that's not written perfectly.\nThis is useful when outputting to CIC programs that do not allow edits. (Note: if\nyou are a captioner , use Flush Word Delay on the Output Formats dialog\ninstead.)\nIf you are using the Edit Buffer, and using a scopist, the Wait For Cursor option\nwill prevent the buffer from being sent until the scopist catches up. This way, the\nbuffer won't be sent until the scopist has had a chance to review it. It work like this:\nwhen the editor gets to the point where the highlighted text (which has not been\nbroadcast yet) is the portion that should not go out, the editor should suspend the\noutput, move the cursor past the text that should be skipped, and then resume the\noutput, leaving it entirely independent of the steno. Also, note that skipped output\ndoes not prevent the text from being re-broadcase with the \"apply edits\" feature. The\nassumption is that the \"apply edits\" feature is disabled, since that feature is\nessentially mutually exclusive with the edit buffer in the first place; you would never\nuse both at the same time.\nIf you select Auto-brief before you begin writing in Realtime, the system will\nwatch what you write and will make up briefs for you on the fly. If it sees you write\nthe same long word or phrase more than once, the second time you write it, Eclipse\nwill suggest a brief.\nIf you check Eclipse is top window, any time a stroke translates in realtime,\nEclipse will jump to the front of any other applications that are running and become\nthe active program.\n496\n666 520 520\n500\nRealtime 491\nSplit Window is another feature related to editing a job while in realtime. If set\nto a number above 0, the screen will be split, showing two views of the realtime job at\nonce. The lower pane will follow the realtime job, but the upper pane will allow you to\nmove the cursor to perform edits. This can also be done with Window menu/Split\n. Enter a number from 1 to 100, indicating the percentage of the screen you want the\nLOWER panel to cover. For example, if you entered \"50\" into the split window text\nbox, your upper and lower window would be shown at equal size. If you entered \"70\",\nyour bottom window would take up 70% of your screen and your top would show 30%\netc.\nAudio Options\nThe WAV Audio settings area at bottom right offers options for the recording\nof audio .\nThe Compression button allows you to select a different CODEC, or sound\nrecording protocol. You will first choose a codec, hit OK, then select a sampling rate\nand hit OK. For most users, the default CODEC of \"PCM, 11.025 KHz, 8 bit mono\" will\nproduce a quality recording, while also minimizing file size. You should only try a\ndifferent CODEC if instructed to by Advantage Software technical support, or by your\ncomputer manufacturer. If your computer has more than one audio input device, you\nwill be asked to select the desired device first.\nWhen you first open this option, the default shows whatever device is selected in\nWindows as the default recording device.\nThe Levels button opens the Windows recording control.

This allows you stop recording , without having to worry\nabout manually restarting it.\nThe Auto-Pause feature exists only for those reporters who are required to prove\nthat their software can automatically pause recording, to prevent the inadvertent\nrecording of off-the-record discussion. If set to a number of minutes above 0, the\naudio recording will automatically pause if no new steno is written for that number of\nminutes.\nVISUALIZERS:\nD2a_Alt+T_for_Realtime.mp4\nD2a_Instant_Realtime.mp4\nD2_Translation_Options_Untrans.mp4\nD3_Pending_Tran_Split_Window.mp4\nD3a_Realtime_Output.mp4\nD3a_Realtime_Output_Buffer.mp4\n1085\n649\n649\n1065\n492 Eclipse Help\nD5_Remote Scoping\nvG5_RT_Kit.mp4\nE3a_Auto-Brief.mp4\nD4d_Multi-Channel Audio.mp4\n15.4 Realtime Status Window\nRealtime Status Window\nRELATES TO: Working With Realtime\n.\nWhen you are in realtime , this window will show you your current\nstatistics.

You will need to uncheck Follow Always on the Realtime tab .\nYou may also find it useful to set up a split view of the realtime job, either with\nthe Split Window item on the Realtime tab , or via Window menu/Split . This\nallows you two different views of the transcript at once; the scopist can edit a\nprevious section of the transcript in one pane, while the reporter follows the realtime\njob in the other.\nEven if you're not working with a scopist, you can perform edits from the\ncomputer keyboard during breaks. Just take control of the cursor with the computer\nkeyboard and edit as normal. The reverse scans are useful here. Alternatively, you\ncan check Stop Follow On Unresolved on the Realtime tab; this will leave the\ncursor at the first trouble spot. From there you can fix the first one, and then scan\nforward to the others.\nEditing From The Writer\nEdit Mode allows a wide variety of editing directly from the steno machine or\nusing voice input both during realtime and during the editing phase.\nThe process of making edits from the steno machine is described in detail in the\ndocument Eclipse Realtime Kit.pdf which is found in the Eclipse\nDocumentation folder.\nTo make edits from the steno machine, you will assign macros to dictionary\nentries. When you write the steno outline, the editing action will be performed.\nFor example, here is a simple realtime editing action:\n483\n1020\n1018 487 963\n487\n487 1085\n340\n487\n339\n425\n31\n1018\nRealtime 495\nThis series of steps will reverse scan to the most recent conflict , select\nchoice 1, retransmit the text to realtime output , and then move back to the\nbottom of the job . By creating a macro of these steps, and then assigning that\nmacro to a dicionary entry , we can perform the entire editing function from the\nsteno machine.\nAll realtime editing functions work on this same principle: you will assign a\nmacro to a dictionary entry, and press the entry to perform the edit.\nWhile you can make your own macros, macros for a great many functions have\nbeen premade for you, and were included when you first created your user. Check the\nEclipse Realtime Kit.pdf file in the Eclipse Documentation folder for a detailed\nlist of macros, and how each one works.\nGlobaling From The Writer\nWhile globaling from the writer works on these same principles, it is a more\ncomplex function. Performing a global from the writer is a three-step process:\n1. Press a steno outline to back to the last untranslate, open it for globaling, and\nenter Keymode or Correction mode.\n2. Write or fingerspell the definition into the global dialog .\n3. Press a steno outline to select the global type , return to Normal translation\nmode, and move the cursor to the bottom of the job.\nWhen globaling from the writer, you will use either Keymode or Correction Mode.\nKeymode allows you to finger-spell into the global dialog; Correction Mode allows you\nto write existing dictionary entries into the global dialog. (Correction mode is for\nquickly correcting untranslates.)\n340\n1049\n313\n1020\n31\n331\n328\n496 Eclipse Help\nEither mode will use KEYMODE.DIX, which is the keymode dictionary. Any\nfunctions that need to be performed while you are in the global dialog -- such as\nselecting a global type, typing a space, or capitalizing a global -- need to be stored in\nthis dictionary.\nThe following default macros will perform global corrections from the writer:\nÂ· Go Define Untran - scans back to the last untranslate, turns on Keymode so you\ncan fingerspell the definition into the globaling window.\nÂ· Go Correct Untran - scans back to the last untranslate, turns on Correction\nMode so you can write the correct outline into the globaling window.\nÂ· Go Correct Misstroke - uses correction mode, but does not scan to an\nuntranslate; the cursor must already be on the word you wish to correct. (To use\nthis, you will need to be able to move the cursor from the steno machine; there\nare realtime editing macros that do this.)\nIn addition, here are some of the entries you will need in KEYMODE.DIX to\neffectively perform globals from the writer:\nÂ· Panic Stroke - escape all dialogs, return to normal translation.\nÂ· Global Job - RT, Global Main - RT, Global Local - RT. Perform the global type\nspecified, return to normal translation.\nÂ· Plus Left Stroke, Plus Right Stroke, Minus Left Stroke, Minus Right Stroke.\nAdds more strokes to the global, allowing you to perform multi-stroke globals.\nÂ· Capitalize Global - RT. Allows you to control the capitalization of a global, by\npressing the Capitalize button on the global dialog .\nÂ· Type:. There are macros that allow you to type braces, spaces, punctuation\nmarks, and other symbols. You must assign these to steno keystrokes to be able\nto type them into the global dialog from the steno machine.\nVISUALIZERS: G5 - Macros\nG5 - RT Kit\n15.5.1 Scopist\nWorking With A SCOPIST\nIf you are a scopist, or are a reporter working with a scopist, there are a few\nsteps you can take to ensure maximum efficiency.\n331\nRealtime 497\nEdit Dictionary\nIf you are a scopist, you will want to create a different user for each of your\nclients. Use the Create New User button to do this.\nYou want to create an entirely different user, because you want each of your\nclients to have their own Edit Dictionary. The Main dictionary slot in a scopist's user is\nreferred to as the Edit Dictionary. Since the edit-only version of Eclipse cannot\ntranslate , the Main dictionary is a place to store Main globals for your client.\nAs you scope, you will make Main dictionary globals on the reporter's behalf. You\nmay then send the Edit dictionary to the reporter; they will have the option to accept\nor reject any Main globals you have made for them. The Edit Dictionary does not have\nto be sent to the reporter after each job; you may accumulate globals over several\njobs, and then share all of them at once.\nWhen the reporter receives the Edit dictionary, they can use any of the block\noperations to merge the Edit dictionary with their Main dictionary. An easy way to\naccomplish this is to open the Edit dictionary, delete any unwanted entries, and\nthen use block read (Alt+R) to merge the entire dictionary.\nJob Dictionaries and Conflicts\nIf the reporter uses conflicts and works with a scopist, they must use the Job\ndictionary to convey them.\nIn addition to storing job-related dictionary entries, the Job dictionary is also\nused as a means of conveyance for conflicts. If set up correctly, the reporter's\nconflicts will benefit from conflict choices made by the scopist. To do this:\n1. Before doing the translation, the reporter must check Make Edit Station Info\non the User settings/Translate tab. When this option is marked, Eclipse\ninserts additional information into the job dictionary that allows scopists to\nreselect conflicts. This will allow your conflict dictionary entries to benefit from\nthe scopist's conflict selections. See the page on working with a scopist for more\ndetail.\n2. When sending the job to the scopist, also send the job dictionary.\n3. The scopist will scope the file, and will make conflict selections.\n4. The scopist will send the job dictionary back to the reporter.\n5. The reporter will look in the Job dictionary for any entries that contain conflict AI\ndata. (Quick way: click the AI column in the dictionary display to sort\nentries by AI data.)\n6. The reporter will transfer any such entries into Main dictionary. (Quick way:\nBlock Write (Alt+W) .\n108\n108\n243 328\n392\n1035\n392\n169\n675\n141\n393\n498 Eclipse Help\n7. The conflict AI data from the scopist will merge with the existing conflict AI data\nin the reporter's Main dictionary.\nFor more details, see the document Eclipse - Reporter & Scopist Dictionary\nManagement.pdf in the Eclipse Documentation folder.\nTracking Changes\nIn the Color Selections area of the Display tab , one of the choices is\nScopist Text Added on the Edit Station. Any text added by the scopist will appear\nin this color. If you have additional editors working using Shared Editing, you can set\na color for each using the 8 user-definable text types at the end of the Color\nselections list.\nIf you are scoping for someone else, but using the full translation version of the\nsoftware as opposed to the edit-only version, check Edit Station on the Edit tab .\nThis will make your system behave like an edit station, meaning that your client will\nbe able to see your changes.\nShared Editing with Connection Magic\nThe simplest way to share an editing session is by using Connection Magic. As\nlong as you have an internet connection, or a LAN (Local Area Network), you can set\nup an editing session that can be joined by any number of other users/scopists. For\ndetails on setting up and using Connection Magic, see the Connection Magic help\npage . Details on using Connection Magic on a LAN are in the Reference\nsection .\nDuring a shared editing session, anytime a paragraph no longer matches the\nreporter version of the document, it must be reconciled with the reporter, undoing any\nfurther changes that the scopist makes to the paragraphs. When that happens,\nEclipse draws the paragraph with a red background to warn the scopist not to edit\nanything in that paragraph until the reconciliation completes.\nDon't edit in paragraphs marked red for reconciliation. Wait until reconciliation has been\ncompleted before you edit this paragraph.\nDivision Intervals\n31\n125 122\n306\n532\n723\nRealtime 499\nThe Division Interval field is a job-sharing feature. You control it using a spin\ncontrol on the User settings/Realtime tab . The number in this field corresponds\nto a time interval in minutes. Each time this interval passes, Eclipse creates a file\nusing the original job name and the time appended. The Division interval will use\nexact times (such as 9:17, 9:32, 9:47) at the intervals you choose. If you want the\nintervals to be at even fractions of an hour, such as 9:00, 9:15, 9:30 and 9:45, (even\nif you started the job at 9:08), set the Division interval to a negative number, such as\n-15. It will then use a division interval of 15 minutes, but will break the divisions on\neven fractions of an hour. If you want divisions at 9:08, 9:23, 9:38, etc., use 15\ninstead of -15.\nThe job name needs to end with an underscore. For example, if the job is called\nSmith_.ecl, the blocks might be called Smith_0900, Smith_0915, Smith_0930, etc.\n(Note: The reporter should include an underscore in the file name to enable the\nincremental files to sync with the realtime .wav file.) The last file, however, will have\nthe exact time the translation was stopped, for example, Smith_0952.\nThe reporter will need to set the DIVISION= path in the File locations section of\nthe Programming tab. The person scoping the incremental files will need to set the\nJobs path to the Reporter's network path. For audio sync, the scopist will need to set\nthe WAV= or WAVPLAY= path in the File locations section of the Programming tab.\n(For details see File Locations .) Scopists can then open and edit a divided file.\nEdited divisions can be recombined into a single file using the Read command.\nNote that this feature can extend filenames beyond eight characters, so make\nsure that your network can handle long filenames, or else use a main jobname with\nfour letters or fewer. (Older Novell networks, for example, may not support long\nfilenames.)\nEclipse will make a copy of the WAV file to the DIVISION folder after the division\ninterval expires. Subsequently, at each division, Eclipse will update that WAV file by\nappending the new data to the end of it.\nIt will also expire during a pause and write out a division at the appropriate time\neven if you aren't writing at that exact moment.\nForce Division\nWhile the division interval is normally set to a number of minutes, you can also\nbreak off a section immediately using Tools/Realtime/Force division. This will\ncause the division interval to split and write out, and a new one will start\nimmediately.\nYou can use this not only with regular intervals, but you can also use manual\nintervals entirely by setting the interval time to an arbitrarily large number such as\n99999 minutes, and then only using the \"Force division\" function to break off\ndivisions.\nDivOverlap setting in your user settings file\n487\n839\n500 Eclipse Help\nIn the user settings file (your .ini file), there is a line that reads \"DivOverlap=2\"\nwhich indicates that there will be 2 paragraphs of overlap in the division interval\nsegments. You can change that to a different number by editing the settings (.ini) file\nmanually, using notepad or a similar text editor. If this number is changed to 0, the\noverlap will be eliminated entirely except for a single word, and the (continuing)\nmessage will be removed.\nVISUALIZERS:\nvH5_Scopist_Dictionary.mp4\nvH5a_Merge_Scopist_Dictionary.mp4\nvD3a_StenoLink.mp4\nvD3a_StenoLink_Setup.mp4\nvD5_Remote_Scoping.mp4\nvD6_Shared_Editing.mp4\nvD6_Shared_Editing Tips.mp4\nvD6d_Connection_Magic_Users_Dialogue.mp4\n15.6 Auto-brief\nAuto-brief\nRELATES TO: Realtime,\nAuto-brief settings dialog,\nAuto-brief ineligible words,\nRequested and Rejected Auto-briefs,\nAuto-brief Steno Theory\nIf you turn on User settings/Realtime/Auto-brief, the system will\nwatch what you write, and when you write a long word in realtime, it will\nmake up a brief for you.\n483\n506\n828\n511\n829\nRealtime 501\nIf it sees you write the same long word or phrase more than once, the\nsecond time you write it, Eclipse will suggest a brief. There are two\nexceptions:\n1. If a single word takes five or more strokes, Eclipse will suggest a\nbrief immediately. Note that this will apply for words that are simply\nlong dictionary entries, words created by adding prefixes and suffixes\nto a root, or even words that are fingerspelled using glue symbols,\nhelpful in captioning and CART.\n2. If you have chosen to use the included dictionaries of briefs from\nMark Kislingbury, Ed Varallo, and Anissa Nierenberger, and you write\na word that appears in one of the dictionaries you included, Eclipse\nwill suggest it the first time you write the word.\nAuto-brief basic features:\nÂ· automatically suggests briefs for long words or phrases you write during\nRealtime, and displays them in a window or in your info-bar\nÂ· fully customizable - choose how many suggestions and reminders of\nexisting briefs you want to see, and other options in User\nsettings/Realtime/Auto-brief/Settings\nÂ· can be displayed in either a pop-up window, or the Info bar, or both.\nÂ· can use hints from experts, including Mark Kislingbury's dictionary of more\nthan 90,000 one-stroke briefs\nÂ· lets you highlight a word and request a brief\nÂ· temporarily saves briefs generated during your realtime job in\nAutoBrief.dix, so you can copy briefs you might want later into your job\ndictionary, before the AutoBrief.dix is cleared, which happens when you\nbegin a new job\nÂ· saves briefs you actually use in your job dictionary\nNormally, the auto-brief dictionary is cleared at the beginning of each\nrealtime translation. Any briefs that you actually used during the previous\nsession were copied to the job dictionary, but briefs that you didn't use\nwould disappear.\nIf you wish to be able to go back and review all of the suggested briefs\nfrom the previous translation in case any of them might be useful, you can\nturn on the User settings/Realtime/Auto-brief settings/Archive all\nsuggested briefs function. With that function on, at the end of each\nrealtime translation, all suggested briefs will be copied to a jobname_AB.dix\nfile for future review. Note that this dictionary will never be automatically\nincluded in any translation.\nAuto-brief display options\n506\n511\n502 Eclipse Help\nEclipse displays the briefs in the top-left corner of the editing window in\na tip window similar to the one used by the Global Magic function.\nYou can resize the auto-brief window by selecting more or fewer briefs,\nand/or adjusting the font in the Auto-brief settings dialog\nThe Auto-brief window can be moved and resized. You can click on the\nwindow anywhere and drag it wherever you like to reposition it. It\nremembers its position relative to the top-left corner of the job window, so if\nyou move the job window, the auto-brief window will move as well.\nYou can also resize the auto-brief window by clicking and dragging the\nsmall black rectangle in the bottom-right corner.\nResizing horizontally will change the font size and make the font larger\nor smaller. The window will resize according to the new font size, and the end\nresult should be close to the size you select.\nResizing vertically will allow more briefs to be visible, up to a maximum\nof 10 briefs. Note that if you make more or fewer briefs visible, the horizontal\nsize of the window may change unexpectedly because as it resizes according\nto the largest brief that is visible, which may or may not be one of the briefs\nthat is visible after increasing or decreasing the number of briefs that are\nvisible.\nThe window will remain visible as long as your cursor is following in\nrealtime. If you move up to the top of the screen, it will disappear out of the\nway, but it will reappear once you leave the top. If long briefs appear, the\nwindow will shift to the left to try to stay visible while making sure that\nnothing goes off the right side of the screen. If you have positioned the\nwindow so that it is not obscuring text, it will not auto-hide.\nAuto-briefs in the pop-up window show in five colors, which you can\ndefine under the User settings/Display/Color selections setup. You can\nchoose different colors for:\nÂ· Suggested briefs -- \"normal\" briefs suggested by the software\nautomatically\nÂ· Reminder briefs -- briefs that you already have in an active dictionary\nÂ· Requested briefs -- briefs that you specifically requested\nÂ· Hint briefs -- suggestions from Kislingbury and SUGGEST.dix\nÂ· Used briefs -- briefs you have actually used\nThe default color for Auto-briefs is colored text on a white background.\nAlso, either a white OR black background for these colors is considered\ntransparent, so it will simply show the color on whatever background is\nappropriate for the window that it's being displayed on.\nHow it works\n506\n511\n515\n516\nRealtime 503\nGenerally, Eclipse is looking for words or phrases that take at least\nthree strokes to write and consist primarily of unusual words (it won't\nsuggest a brief for \"in the event\" but it will suggest one for \"Department of\nInternal Affairs\" or \"hydrodynamics.\")\nThe brief Eclipse suggests will be generated automatically by\nattempting a large number of potential candidates based on your phonetics\ntable and testing to make absolutely sure that it doesn't conflict with\nanything in any dictionary currently being used. You can be assured that if\nEclipse suggests a brief, it is a stroke (or double stroke) that is not being\nused in any of the dictionaries currently being used by the translator.\nIt will attempt to find a one-stroke brief if possible. If it cannot, it will\nsuggest a double stroke, such as TPO TPO for \"photoelectric cells.\"\nBriefs are usable immediately. The moment one appears in the\nsuggestion window, you can start writing it. No other work is necessary.\nIf you actually write one of the briefs during the course of a job, that\nbrief will be saved in your current job dictionary so that you can re-use in\nother translations, or if you need to retranslate a portion of the same file.\nThe brief suggestion window will display up to nine briefs at once by\ndefault. After that, the briefs will start to scroll off the window. However, they\nwill still be active and you can still write them if you remember what they\nwere. You can increase the number of briefs to be displayed in the Auto-brief\nsettings dialog.\nIf you forget and write something out the long way for an alreadycreated\nbrief, it will show you the brief again, adding it back to the end of the\nbrief window.\nYou can look up all of the briefs during a break by hitting F9 and\nopening the AutoBrief.dix file that will appear at the end of the list of\ndictionaries being used by the current translation.\nIf you delete an entry from the AutoBrief.dix, that brief will be removed\nfrom the auto-brief window if it's one of the entries still visible.\nIf you're using the auto-brief feature and you wish to force the system\nto give you a brief without waiting for you to write something twice, just\nmark the text you want a brief for using F7, and use the Add dictionary entry\nfunction.\nAuto-brief ineligible words can be found under User\nsettings/Programming /Auto-brief ineligible words .\nPlurals\nAuto-briefs can detect plurals and suggest singulars. So, if you write a\nlong word that is pluralized, such as \"hydrodynamics\", the auto-brief feature\nmight suggest a brief for it. If it can detect that it's a pluralized form of a\nword (in other words, if it sees that \"hydrodynamic\" is a legitimate word),\nthen it will suggest a brief for the singular version instead of the plural\nversion.\n506\n828\n504 Eclipse Help\nIf you have the User settings/Translate/Integral pre/suf feature\nturned on, then you will be able to write the integral prefix or suffix with the\nsuggested brief. For example, if it suggests H*EU = hydrodynamic, you can\nwrite H*EUS to get hydrodynamics.\nSaving your briefs\nIf you actually write one of the briefs during the course of a job, that\nbrief will be saved in your current job dictionary so that you can re-use it in\nother translations, or if you need to retranslate a portion of the same file. The\nauto-brief entries are marked with an \"AB\" in the comment field. You can sort\nthe dictionary by comment line, causing the auto-brief entries to cluster\ntogether so you can review them easily.\nYou can look up all of the briefs during a break by hitting F9 and\nopening the AutoBrief.dix file that will appear at the end of the list of\ndictionaries (in or below dictionary #9) being used by the current translation.\nIf you delete an entry from the AutoBrief.dix, that brief will also be removed\nfrom the auto-brief window if it's one of the entries still visible. You can keep\nAutoBrief.dix open while you do Realtime.\nRecord of Brief reminder statistics\nThe REMIND.DIX file is a collection of all of the briefs you have been\nreminded about. Unlike the AutoBrief.dix file, which starts empty with every\ntranslation, this is a permanent record and you can consult it at any time.\nIf you see a reminder that is actually a mistake or slop stroke or old\ntheory or other type of dictionary entry that you would like to remove, open\nthe REMIND dictionary file and if an entry appears with no comment, it's a\ncopy of an entry in your main dictionary. If it came from a job or special\ndictionary, that dictionary name will appear as the comment for that entry,\nmaking it easy to find and remove or repair.\nRealtime 505\nNote that the used \"#\" column in the dictionary records the number of\ntimes that you have been reminded of these briefs. Sorting this dictionary by\nthe # column will therefore show you the brief forms you most need to work\non memorizing in order to make your writing more efficient.\nAuto-brief ineligible words list and Auto-brief steno theory\nIn the User Settings/Programming tab there are two features to help\nyou further customize your auto-briefs: the Auto-brief ineligible words list\nand the Auto-brief steno theory option. For details on how to use these\ncontrols, see Auto-brief Ineligible Words and Auto-brief Steno Theory .\nNote that if your steno theory limitations make it completely impossible\nfor the auto-brief feature to come up with a brief that fits the text, it will\nmake a second pass with reduced rules. These \"emergency briefs\" will\ngenerally result in a double-stroke brief, which is better than none at all.\nVISUALIZERS:\nvE3a_Auto-Brief.mp4\nvE3a_Auto-Brief_Settings.mp4\nvE3a -Auto-Brief Customization.mp4\nvE3a_Auto-Brief_Display.mp4\n828 515\n506 Eclipse Help\nvE3a_Auto-Brief_Request_Reject.mp4\nvE3a_Auto_Brief_Remind-Suggest.mp4\n15.6.1 Auto-brief Settings dialog\nAuto-brief Settings\nDialog\nRELATES TO: Auto-briefs ,\nRealtime .\nIn User settings/Realtime, next to the Auto-brief checkbox, there is\na Settings button which opens the Auto-brief settings dialog.\n500\n483\nRealtime 507\nÂ· Suggest briefs automatically - This feature is on by default. Only turn it\noff if you never want Eclipse to suggest a brief that you haven't already\nused, or requested. You can choose how many times the word must appear\nbefore offering a brief for it. The default is to \"Suggest briefs automatically\nafter 2 occurrences.\"\nÂ· Require accept stroke - Turn on this feature if you want to use the briefgenerating\nfeatures of auto-brief, but you don't want to have the briefs be\nimmediately active.\nIf you have this option on, the briefs that appear automatically in the\nbrief window will NOT immediately available for use, so hitting the strokes\nindicated will behave normally. You can put an {ABACCEPT} entry in your\ndictionary to accept the last auto-brief. Hitting that entry will take the last\nbrief in the list and copy it to your job dictionary, at which point, the brief\nwill be active and will appear in the \"Requested briefs\" color.\nIf you wish to accept an entry that is NOT the last entry in the brief\nwindow, you will have to first remove any suggested entries below it in the\nwindow using the {ABREJECT} entry.\nWhen you have the Require accept stroke feature turned on, and you\nright-click on an auto-brief in the pop-up window, a context window opens\nthat includes Accept, which enables you to accept the suggested brief.\nÂ· Reposition - Press the reposition button to send the pop-up brief window\nback to a default location.\nÂ· Pop-up window and Info bar - These options let you choose to turn the\npop-up window on or off, and to put the auto-briefs in the info bar. Since\nthe info bar is so long, if you're using the info bar instead of the pop-up\nwindow, you can boost the maximum number of briefs shown in each\ncategory quite a bit more.\n508 Eclipse Help\nNote that next to each different type of brief, there are four columns. In\naddition to the \"pop-up\" checkbox and the \"info bar\" checkbox, which\ndetermines whether the briefs appear in the info bar or pop-up window at all,\ntwo of the columns allow you to determine exactly how many of each brief\ntype will appear in each place.\nSo, if you want reminders only on your info bar, set the pop-up value to\nzero. If you want requests only on your pop-up, set the info bar value to\nzero. If you want 3 suggestions on the pop-up window and 10 suggestions in\nyour info bar, no problem; set the numbers accordingly. Note that in both\nplaces, the end of the list will be displayed, so in the final example, the three\nsuggestions on the pop-up window will match the most recent three of the\nten suggestions on the info bar.\nThe other two columns, labelled (order), enable you to specify which\ncategory is displayed first, second, third, etc. Note that the order can be\ndifferent for the auto-brief pop-up window and the briefs that appear in the\ninfobar.\nThe option to display Auto-briefs in the Info bar can also be turned on or\noff in the Window menu/View Toggles.\nÂ· Reminders , Theory Hints , Requests , Suggestions, and\nUsed - The 5 spin controls in this area allow you to select the number of\nbriefs that appear in each category. Items in the auto-brief window will\nappear in that order, color-coded as defined in User settings/Display .\nSince each category has its own individual upper limit, a large number\nof reminders will not scroll the suggestions off the screen. Likewise, a large\nnumber of suggestions will not scroll very important requested briefs off the\nscreen.\nÂ· Minimum keys - This setting allows you to define the minimum number of\nkeys in a suggested brief.\nThe auto-brief function will normally find the smallest possible sequence\nof steno keys that you are not already using for something else. For example,\nif you write \"teleological\" in five strokes, auto-brief is perfectly happy to\nsuggest TE for that if you aren't already using the TE stroke by itself for\nanything else.\nIf you don't want it to ever suggest very small briefs, you can specify a\nminimum number of steno keys that an automatically-generated brief should\ncontain. If you set that value to 4, for example, then it might suggest T*EL\ninstead.\nNote: This option will try to make a stroke out of the minimum value you\nhave chosen, in terms of both phonetic elements (computer keystrokes) and\nsteno keys.\nFor example, if you have it set to 4 and you write \"goliath\" it will NOT\nsimply accept TKPWO as a result, even though it has 5 keys, because it only\nhas two phonetic elements (\"go\").\n511 515 511\n516\n122\nRealtime 509\nInstead, it will start by attempting to phoneticize \"goli\", which will end\nup with TKPWHROEU, which will be accepted since it contains at least 4 keys.\nLikewise, if you have \"allocation\" it will start by attempting to\nphoneticize \"allo\" but since there are only three unique letters, it will end up\nwith AOL, which is fewer than four keys, so it will keep extending.\nNote: This setting will apply to each stroke in a double-stroke\nsuggestion, because very short double-stroke suggestions sometimes cause\nunexpected results if the individual strokes happen to match an entry in your\ndictionary that could conceivably be written twice in a row intentionally.\nÂ· Minimum reminder savings - This is the minimum number of strokes\nthat must be saved by a brief in order for it to remind you when you've\nwritten something the long way.\nYou can, however, ask for reminder briefs any word or phrase, regardless\nof whether it meets the minimum reminder savings.\nThe default setting is 2. If you want it to remind you if there is any\nsavings at all, set it to 1. You can, of course, set it larger.\nOptionally only show reminders for commented entries:\nIf you set the minimum stroke savings to 0 (zero), it doesn't disable the\nfeature, but what it will do is only remind you of briefs if they are commented\nin some way. In other words, if a brief has \"AB\" in the comment field, or\n\"brief\" or anything else at all, it will be eligible to come up as a reminder.\nNote that with this setting, any number of stroke savings is valid. It is\nequivalent to a setting of 1 with the extra criterion of requiring the comment.\nÂ· Maximum phrase words - Auto-brief scans for phrases containing words\nnot on the ineligible words list. This setting allows you to specify the\nmaximum number of words that the auto-brief will include in a suggestion.\nÂ· Expert Theory Hints - Eclipse includes auto-brief hints from 3 experts:\nMark Kislingbury, Anissa Nierenberger, and Ed Varallo. If you check the box\nfor Mark's hints, you will have access to over 90,000 briefs developed by\nMark Kislingbury and provided to Eclipse users. When you turn this on, and\nuse one of his briefs, it will appear in your dictionary with MK AB in the\nComments column. The briefs will appear the first time you write a word\nfor which there is a brief (unlike regular suggestions which only appear\nafter you have written the word twice. Mark's suggestions are part of his\nMagnum Steno theory, so if you try them out and like what you see, you\nshould consider looking at his theory materials at www.magnumsteno.com.\nAdditional databases have been provided by Anissa Nierenberger\n(Dictionary Jumpstart), and Ed Varallo (EdVarallo.com).\nNote that the auto-brief display will include the two-letter comments\nidentifying whose briefs they are. You can include your own initials in the\n510 Eclipse Help\ndictionary entry comment for briefs you create, and they will also appear in\nthe reminders.\nÂ· Archive all suggested briefs - Normally, the auto-brief dictionary is\ncleared at the beginning of each realtime translation. Any briefs that you\nactually used during the previous session were copied to the job dictionary,\nbut briefs that you didn't use would disappear.\nIf you wish to be able to go back and review all of the suggested briefs\nfrom the previous translation in case any of them might be useful, you can\nturn on the Archive all suggested briefs function. At the end of each\nrealtime translation, all suggested briefs will be copied to a jobname_AB.dix\nfile for future review. Note that this dictionary will never be automatically\nincluded in any translation.\nÂ· Show as: - Use this drop-down list to select how you want your briefs to\nappear.\nÂ· Show briefs phonetically - This setting is used to determine whether or\nnot auto-brief steno is displayed phonetically. If you have this turned on,\nthen the auto-brief suggestions will be shown in semi-phonetic format\n(upper case). In other words, if the system sees ?globalization\" and wants\nto suggest TKPWHRO, it will display GLO = globalization.\nÂ· Font - This option allows you to select the font and size specifically, which\nin turn controls the horizontal size of the Auto-brief pop-up window. When\nAuto-briefs are displayed in the Info bar, they will wrap, rather than resizing\nthe Info bar.\nNote that you can also select the colors for the auto-briefs in User\nsettings/Display/Color selections. If you change the background color, it\nwill also change the background color of the auto-brief window.\nRealtime 511\nÂ· Max Width - This setting word-wraps brief in the pop-up window to a\nmaximum width. By default, it's set to 0, which disables the feature.\nSetting it to a particular value forces the auto-briefs to word-wrap within\nthat limit. This is particularly helpful when using the auto-brief window on\na small second screen. If you know that your second screen is 600 pixels\nwide, for example, then set the auto-brief width to 600 and the briefs will\nnever extend past the width of that screen.\nÂ· Allow numbers - Normally, the auto-brief function will ignore anything\ncontaining digits, and will ensure that suggested strokes never contain\ndigits. If you wish to be able to auto-brief number sequences, turn on Allow\nnumbers.\nNote that just turning on this option will not produce ideal results, since\nwriting a long number such as 574,974.23 would result in a suggested steno\nbrief of \"57\". This could cause big problems when writing a number. If you\nintend to use this feature, it is recommended that you supply additional keys\nto be added to number briefs.\nAuto-brief can suggest briefs containing numbers such as dates: \"May\n12, 2007\". If you have the numbers enabled in the auto-brief function, AND\nyou remove the months from the list of auto-brief ineligible words found\nunder User settings/Programming, then dates in this format will have\nwith a brief suggested for them.\nÂ· Transparency - Allows you to control the transparency of the pop-up\nwindow.\nÂ· Ineligible words and Theory settings - Open the corresponding\ndialogs in the Programming Tab of User Settings.\n15.6.2 Rejecting, Requesting, Changing or Deleting Briefs\nRejecting, Requesting,\nChanging or Deleting Briefs\nRELATES TO: Auto-brief .\nYou can set up Dictionary entries to Accept, Reject or Request Auto-brief\nsuggestions.\n828 515\n500\n512 Eclipse Help\nFirst, go to the Auto-brief settings dialog, which you can open by\ngoing to User settings/Realtime, and clicking the Settings button next to\nAuto-brief. It can also be opened in the Windows menu/View toggles\ndialog by clicking the Setup button next to Auto-briefs.\nIf you uncheck the box \"Suggest briefs automatically\" (which is\nchecked by default), Eclipse will only show you Reminders of previously\nused briefs, and Requested briefs. Only turn it off if you never want Eclipse\nto suggest a brief that you haven't already used, or requested.\nRequests\nIf you're using the auto-brief feature and you wish to force the system\nto give you a brief without waiting for you to write something twice, just\nmark the text you want a brief for (F7 to mark) and use the Add dictionary\nentry function.\nYou can specify attributes. If you block mark a piece of text such as\n\"The Speaker pro tempore\" complete with italics and ask for a brief, it will be\nplaced in the briefs as \"The Speaker{i}pro tempore{n}\" as required. This will\nwork for all attributes.\nReminders\nIf you mark a word or phrase and request a brief, first Eclipse will see if\nthat word or phrase already has a brief, and if so, it will remind you of it.\n(This is just one of several ways to trigger a reminder brief.) If there is no\nbrief for the word or phrase, Eclipse will suggest one. If you have AutoMagic\nturned on, there will be an item for creating a brief on the fly for the marked\ntext.\nRealtime 513\nAuto-brief will display reminders of existing briefs immediately, once\nyou write something the long way, no matter how few words you've written\nor whether any of those words are on the ineligible words list.\nFor example, even if you write two separate strokes U = you and -R =\nare, you will get an immediate \"you are = UR\" reminder from your dictionary\nif you have that brief defined.\nThe reminder feature will only show one reminder per word or phrase,\neven if it can find multiple briefs for it in the dictionaries. It will first narrow\ndown the reminder possibilities by stroke and will show the shortest one. If\nthere are multiple entries with the same number of strokes, it will pick the\none with the smallest number of keys, assuming that that is the correct entry\nand the rest are probably misstrokes.\nYou can set the Minimum reminder savings to control when you will be\noffered reminders. If the number of strokes saved for reminders is set to\nzero, it won't give you any reminders except those that have a comment.\nTo use these features, first be sure these entries are in your\nmetadictionary (They are there by default for all version of Eclipse from 4.3\non):\nÂ· {ABACCEPT}={/?ABA}\nÂ· {ABREJECT}={/?ABD}\nÂ· {ABNEW}={/?ABN}\nIf you want to use the brief-generating features of auto-brief, but you\ndon't want to have the briefs be immediately active, you can turn on the\nRequire accept stroke feature. If you have that option on, the briefs that\nappear automatically in the brief window will NOT be immediately available\nfor use, so hitting the strokes indicated will behave normally.\nThen, to accept a suggested brief, put an {ABACCEPT} entry in your\ndictionary. Hitting that entry will take the last brief in the list and copy it to\nyour job dictionary, at which point, the brief will be active and will appear in\nthe Brief requested color.\nAuto-brief may suggest a shortcut that would be helpful, but you want\nto use different steno. In this case, you would use the steno you have\ndefined in your dictionary as {ABNEW}, which will reject the last brief that\nwas offered, deleting it from the auto-brief dictionary and from the on-screen\nsuggestions and placing it in the REJECT.DIX file to prevent it from being\nsuggested again. It will then suggest a new brief for the same word or\nphrase using different steno. The new brief will be in Requested brief color.\nIf the system offers a suggestion and you use {ABNEW}, the new\nsuggestion will still appear on the âsuggestedâ briefs list. If you request a\nbrief for a word or phrase and then hit {ABNEW} because you don't like the\nsteno it gave you, it will put the new item on the ârequestedâ briefs list. In\nother words, it will put the new suggestion on the same list it deleted it from.\nIf you wish to use {ABNEW} to accept an entry that is NOT the last\nentry in the brief window, you will first have to remove any suggested entries\nbelow it in the window using the {ABREJECT} entry.\n514 Eclipse Help\nThere are additional options for supplying suggestions of your own. If\nyou ask for different steno but you don't like any of the suggestions and\nwould like to supply your own, you can use {ABSTENO} or {ABMODIFY} to\nchange the steno of the last entry in the auto-brief list, or use {ABMODIFY}\nto change a specific suggestion.\n{ABSTENO} will immediately remove the last entry and will ask you to\nhit a steno stroke. The stroke you hit will be used as a brief for the text that\nwas originally suggested.\nFor example, if you defined ST*EPB = {ABSTENO} in your dictionary, if\nthe last brief was TPH-T = Nicola Tesla, you could hit ST*EPB / TPHEUBGT\nand it would change to TPHEUBGT = Nicola Tesla\n{ABMODIFY} will ask you to hit a steno stroke for an existing brief. It\nwill then delete the brief and ask you for a replacement stroke. The stroke\nyou hit will be used as a brief for the text that was originally suggested.\nFor example, if you defined PH*OD = {ABMODIFY} in your dictionary,\nand the brief above was somewhere above the last brief, you could hit PH*OD\n/ TPH-T / TPHEUBGT and it would change.\nThese require the following metadictionary entries:\n{ABSTENO}={/?ABT}\n{ABMODIFY}={/?ABM}\nIn the Auto-brief settings dialog, note the Reminders, Requests, and\nSuggestions spin controls. These allow you to select the number of briefs\nthat appear in each category. Items in the auto-brief window will appear in\nthat order, color-coded as defined in User settings/Display .\nSince each category has its own individual upper limit, a large number\nof reminders will not scroll the suggestions off the screen. Likewise, a large\nnumber of suggestions will not scroll very important requested briefs off the\nscreen.\nReject.dix file and Rejecting the last brief\nRejected auto-briefs will go into a temporary REJECT.DIX file, which\nresets itself every job. It prevents the auto-brief function from suggesting\nthe same steno brief for a particular word or phrase after it has been\nrejected. It may still suggest another brief for that same word or phrase in\nthe future, but it will not use the same steno.\nThis is used both by the ABReject feature and when you manually delete\nan entry from the AutoBrief.dix file.\n122\nRealtime 515\nIf you define a dictionary entry containing {ABREJECT}, it will reject the\nlast brief that was offered, deleting it from the auto-brief dictionary and from\nthe on-screen suggestions and placing it in the REJECT.DIX file to prevent it\nfrom being suggested again. It may still suggest another brief for that same\nword or phrase in the future, but it will not use the same steno. The threeletter\nmetadictionary code to reject the steno for the last brief offered\nis{ABREJECT}={/?ABD}.\nIf you define a dictionary entry containing {ABNEW} it will reject the\nlast brief that was offered, deleting it from the auto-brief dictionary and from\nthe on-screen suggestions and placing it in the REJECT.DIX file. The threeletter\nmetadictionary code to request new steno for the last brief offered is\n{ABNEW}={/?ABN}.\nAdditional options in Auto-brief\n{ABSELECT} prompts you for the stroke for a brief you wish to use,\nand will move that brief to the \"requested\" list, so it will be available for use\nimmediately.\n{ABCHANGE} will prompt you for the steno stroke for a specific autobrief\nthat you want a new steno suggestion for.\n{ABDELETE} will remove any brief from your auto-brief dictionary and\nthe auto-brief window. Simply hit {ABDELETE}, followed by the brief you\nwant removed, and it will be deleted.\nDeleting or modifying 2-stroke briefs\nYou can use {ABDELETE} to delete 2-stroke briefs. After you hit a\nstroke to indicate which brief to delete, Eclipse will check the single-stroke\nversion, and if that doesn't exist, will check for a double-stroke version.\nSo, if auto-brief suggests a double-stroke brief such as SEU SEU, you\ncan just hit {ABDELETE}SEU to delete it. Similarly, you could use\n{ABCHANGE}SEU to ask for a new suggestion.\n15.6.3 Auto-brief theory hints\nAuto-brief: Theory Hints\nRELATES TO: Auto-brief 500 .\n516 Eclipse Help\nThe auto-brief suggestions that are shown when you have one or more of the\n\"Expert theory hints\" turned on, or by having entries in a SUGGEST.dix file, are not\nquite the same as suggestions that come from the automatically generated briefs.\nTypical auto-brief suggestions are intended to be temporary shortcuts for\ncommon long words and phrases that you are using in a specific job. The suggestions\nfrom Kislingbury and SUGGEST.dix are intended to be suggestions about ways you\ncould actually improve your steno theory and write certain words shorter in general.\nFor that reason, these suggestions are a separate category of auto-briefs called\n\"Theory hints.\" There are separate maximum number settings for them in the User\nsettings/Realtime/Auto-brief settings.\nThere is also a separate color option (\"Hint briefs\") for them under User\nsettings/Display/Color selections.\nTo disable theory tags, uncheck Visible tags.\n15.6.4 Used Briefs\nAuto-brief: Used Briefs\nRELATES TO: Auto-brief .\nEclipse keeps track of which briefs you have actually used, and they will\nbecome \"sticky\" and will stay on the display.\n500\nRealtime 517\nFor most briefs, the suggestions list fills up and starts scrolling older\nsuggestions off the list. But in most cases, you will want the briefs that were\nactually useful to stay visible. So, these will go into a category of Used\nbriefs. Any briefs that you have actually used at any time during the\ntranslation will not scroll off the suggestion list as new suggestions appear,\nuntil you reach the number you specified in the Auto-brief settings dialog.\nSince the Used category has its own setting for how many to display in the\nlist, you can make the number as large as your display/font size can handle.\nAs you use new briefs, older used briefs will scroll off the used list. The\nbriefs do not simply scroll off chronologically, however. Instead, the more you\nuse a brief, the LOWER priority it becomes. That's because the more you use\nit, the more likely you are to remember it and not need it on the screen\nanymore. So the most-frequently used ones will scroll off the list, and the\nleast used ones will stay there to remind you until you begin to use them.\n15.7 AUTOBLOCK\nAUTOBLOCK\nAUTOBLOCK works in any situation where speakers use prepared texts. It is\nmost useful for reporters who work in court where judges may use dozens of prepared\nstatements such as jury charges, etc.\nYou enter the prepared text into an AUTOBLOCK file, and when Eclipse detects\nthat you are writing something that matches one of these prepared texts it will\ndisplay a list of matching texts, and when you select the right one, Eclipse will\ncomplete it for you.\nFor example, you might write \"As the jury in this\" and the software will show a\npop-up window containing numbered lines \"1: (Criminal Jury Charge.ecl) ...case, you\nwill be the judges of the facts...\" \"2: (Civil Jury Charge.ecl) ...case, you will be...\" etc.\nYou can then pick one, and the rest of the text will be filled in. Note that you can\nwrite as much as you want before this happens, or simply continue writing. Eclipse\nwill always pick up from where you stopped writing the text.\nHere's how it works:\nCreate a folder for these prepared texts. Create \"descriptive file name.ecl\" files\nin that folder.\nUnder User settings/Programming/File locations, add an AUTOBLOCK line\nsuch as\nAUTOBLOCK={JOB}Blocks/Auto or AUTOBLOCK={JOB}Prepared texts or\nAUTOBLOCK={MAIN}Shared auto-blocks.\nYou can use whatever location you like, but if you put the AUTOBLOCK folder in\nyour JOB folder, you will see it when you go to File/Open text.\n518 Eclipse Help\nIt should NOT be the same as your regular BLOCK folder because you don't want\nit auto-completing whole title pages, certificates, appearances, etc., just based on the\nfirst few words happening to match what you're writing.\nAdd lines to your main dictionary for selecting auto-blocks. You probably only\nneed a few numbers, since the list will be narrowed down depending on how many\ndifferent blocks match the text that you have written so far:\nA*UB 1 = {AUTOBLOCK1}\nA*UB 2 = {AUTOBLOCK2}\nA*UB 3 = {AUTOBLOCK3}\netc. (the actual steno is entirely up to you.)\nOnce you have made these preparations, any time you are writing realtime and\nyou see the auto-block pop-up window, you can hit one of the {AUTOBLOCKx}\ndictionary entries with the number of the block you want to use, and that will be filled\nin automatically.\nRealtime 519\n15.8 Realtime Output\nWorking With REALTIME\nOUTPUT\nRELATES TO: Output Formats , Working With\nRealtime , Realtime tab .\nEclipse's realtime output feature allows you to do realtime, and send a realtime\nfeed to one or more recipients. For example, you can send a transcript to a judge's\ncomputer via cable. Captioning is also a form of realtime output; it can also be\nused to display text on marquee devices, or for remote live scoping .\nTo set up realtime output, you must first set up realtime .\nOnce you have basic realtime working, you will first need a means to send the\nrealtime output to the recipient. If you are sending the transcript to the judge and/or\nattorney(s), it is typical to send via a cable connection. You will need to get a second\nCOM port; this can be done via the same techniques given in the section on realtime\nhardware . Acquire a device, install it, and make a note of the COM port number.\nOnce you have an output port, you will select the COM port number, speed,\noutput type, and other options in Output Formats , which can be accessed from\nthe Realtime tab .\nIt it also possible to send realtime output by other means, such as a phone\nmodem (typical for captioning) or a network connection: see Output Formats for\nfurther information.\nVISUALIZERS:\nvD3_Realtime_Setup.mp4\nvD3a_Realtime_Output.mp4\nvD3a_Realtime_Output_Buffer.mp4\nvD3a_Wireless.mp4\nvD3b_Bridge.mp4\nvD3b_Bridge_Pro.mp4\nvD3c Bridge Mobile.mp4\nvD5_Remote_Scoping.mp4\nvD6d_Connection Magic Users Dialogue\nvD6_Shared_Editing.mp4\nvD6_Shared_Editing Tips.mp4\n520\n483 487\n666\n527\n483\n484\n520\n487\n520\n520 Eclipse Help\nvA8_CART_Window.mp4\nvL4_AccuCAP.mp4\n15.9 Output Formats\nOutput Formats\nRELATES TO: Realtime tab , Working With\nRealtime Output .\nThis dialog allows you to set up one or more formats for realtime output .\nTo get here, you must click Add or Change from the Realtime tab of User\nsettings. The changes you make in this dialog will affect either a new output format\n(if you clicked Add), or an existing one (if you clicked Change).\nSelecting A Format\nOutput Format is the type of output you are doing. Most of these are CIC\nprograms, but others are specialty outputs:\nÂ· Bridge/Mobile\n487\n519\n519\n487\nRealtime 521\nÂ· Legal Assistant.\nÂ· LiveNote.\nÂ· Summation/Caseview.\nÂ· Closed Captioning. For use in captioning .\nÂ· Silent Radio. A type of marquee.\nÂ· ANSI. Will output to a text file, similar to an ASCII file.\nÂ· Eclipse StenoLink . Enables remote live scoping.\nÂ· Keyboard Macro. Will output to the active window. This can be used for internet\nchats; select any Windows program, and the output will go to it. You will need to\ncreate a macro called K:BACKSPACE which will serve as a backspace for the\nprogram you are outputting to. Most of the time, this macro consists of one\nkeystroke, the backspace key. You may also want to create a macro called\nK:LINEFEED which will be sent each time you reach the end of a line. Assign\nthese macros to dictionary entries so you can invoke them when needed.\nÂ· Trans-Lux Datawall. A type of marquee.\nÂ· Teletext. The European captioning standard. If you are captioning in Europe,\nselect this instead of Closed Captioning.\nÂ· LED Captionvision Display. A type of marquee.\nÂ· Incremental ASCII. For use with certain types of marquee devices. Some thirdparty\ndevices work with updates consisting exactly what should appear on the\nscreen in its entirety. Currently, only Daktronics brand display software uses this\nformat. This output format creates a file called CC.TXT, which the device would\naccess.\nÂ· Chyron CODI character generator.\nÂ· CART window - a separate window that will open up below Eclipse. The CART\nwindow displays just the text, without any icons or toolbars. It can be moved,\nresized, and anchored. The CART window is independent from the Eclipse window\nand can be moved to a separate screen, such as a projector or an external\nmonitor. Note that if you anchor a CART window that is on an external monitor,\nthis could result in the window accidentally being placed where you cannot see if\nyou later attempt to use it on your system when you do not have the external\nmonitor attached.\nÂ· YouTube Captioning\n666\n527\n1018\n1020\n942\n522 Eclipse Help\nSelecting an Output Method\nOnce you have selected what you're outputting to, you will have to select the\nmeans of output. Select the method from the COMM Device list, and then click the\nSetup button to configure it. Your options are:\nÂ· COM Port. The realtime output will be sent via cable, through a second COM port\n(the first one is for your realtime connection.) Click Setup to open the COMM\nSetup dialog . Select the COM port you are using, and the baud rate your\nrecipients are using. Leave the other items at their defaults.\nÂ· File Sharing. This option will create a file. Click Setup to select a folder for the file\nto be created in. (If you do not, it will be created in your Jobs folder . The file\nwill have the same name as the job, and will have a .CIC extension .\nÂ· TCP/IP Direct. Will output to a specific address on the internet or on a network.\nClick Setup to enter the desired web address, and port number. This feature is\nmostly for use with Teleview: see the Teleview documentation for further details.\nÂ· Connection Magic\nÂ· None.\nCIC Options\nThe remaining options on the Output Formats dialog pertain to the realtime\noutput. Most of them are specific to captioning ; they will be addressed in the next\nsection. If you are not doing captioning, you need only worry about the items in this\nsection. Note: depending on the type of output you are doing, some of these options\nmay be grayed out: if so, they do not pertain to your output.\nÂ· Apply Edits. If checked, the realtime output will refresh to reflect any realtime\nediting you do in the transcript in Eclipse. Only applies to\nBridge/Lawbridge/Teleview.\nÂ· Deny saving can be checked and left on permanently. This will periodically send a\ndeny saving command to the receiving computers while they're connected. It\ndoes this periodically because on a serial connection, an attorney who hooks up\nlate might not have received the âdenyâ command and would therefore be\npermitted to save the file.\nÂ· All Caps will output in all capital letters.\nÂ· Force Margins, if checked, will force the output to follow the margins entered into\nthe Left, Right, and Indentation boxes. Note that Force margins will only be\nallowed if you have multiple outputs. If you have just one output and want to use\nforced margins, you need to add a separate null output such as a second ANSI\noutput with \"None\" as the communication device. After adding a second output,\nyou will be able to change the output you are using and set your forced margins.\n483\n947\n906\n971\n532\n666\nRealtime 523\nIf not, the regular settings on the Paragraphs tab will be used. Force margins\ncan only be used when using multiple outputs for when using only a single ANSI\noutput.\nÂ· Allow Backspaces will allow the delete strokes to be sent to the output. This may\ngive you the ability to delete text after it has been sent. Most captioning\nstandards do not allow this, however, it may be acceptable in CIC.\nÂ· Flush Word Delay is the amount of time the system will when you stop writing to\nsend the last word you wrote to the output. This allows time to add punctuation\nor suffixes. The flush word delay is only applicable if a word is pending output\nlong enough for the flush word delay to expire. If you are not using Allow\nBackspaces, you can set this to a number of seconds (such as 2000 for two\nseconds); this will give you an opportunity to correct mistakes before they are\nsent to the output. NOTE: This is not the same as Flush Delay on the realtime\ntab ; that setting pertains to the delay between writing and translation.\nWhile writing continuously the flush word delay is not applicable. To flush the\npending output buffer and send all pending words use a stroke defined as\n{FLUSH}.\nÂ· Maximum WPM is a maximum speed, in words per minute, at which the realtime\nwill be sent. If you write faster than this, the output will be delayed. This\nprevents the output from becoming too fast to read.\nÂ· Header is a line of text that will appear at the beginning of each page.\nÂ· Language allows you to select from a drop-down list of over 100 languages. If\nyou leave it at \"Default\" the current language is transmitted normally. If you\nselect any other language, that output will be transmitted after Google\nTranslate has a chance to translate it.\nÂ· Attribute can be set to Underline, Bold, or Italics, if you want your output text to\ndefault to one of those forms. The default is Normal.\nNote: The Bridge output will transmit the filename every page, so if a Bridge user\nhooks up late, they will get the appropriate file name.\nCaptioning Options\nThe following items on the Output Formats dialog pertain to captioning only (or\nto certain types of marquee devices).\nÂ· If Auto-Dial is checked, Eclipse will automatically open the Phone Numbers\ndialog when you start a realtime job. If not, you will have to open it manually.\nÂ· Timeout to Blank will automatically blank the captioning display, if no new\ncaptions are sent after a period of time. Set this to the desire number of\nmilliseconds (such as 10000 for ten seconds). If set to 0, the captioning display\nwill only blank when you sent a blank command.\n447\n487\n525\n1038\n524 Eclipse Help\nÂ· Wait Time to Blank is the amount of time the system will wait after receiving a\nblank command. If set to 0, the command will take effect instantly.\nÂ· Starting and Total Rows are the initial position of the captions when the job\nbegins. They use the same syntax as vertical positioning commands in\ncaptioning . Max Rows is the maximum number of rows the device can display.\nThe default setting is 15 rows, which is the standard for captioning.\nÂ· Select Roll-Up Captions or Pop-On Captions to determine the initial style of your\ncaptions. This can be changed during the job, by using commands . If you are\nworking primarily in Pop-On Captions, checking Pre-Send will make them display\nfaster.\nÂ· Foreground and Background are the starting foreground and background colors of\nthe captioning text. The captioning default is for white text on a black\nbackground. Also, some marquee devices can accept color changes through these\nsettings.\nÂ· Semi-Transparent will make the captions partially transparent. Not all encoders\nhave this ability.\nÂ· Mode and Hangup Mode are the default modes for connecting and disconnecting,\nrespectively. It is best to leave both of these on the default setting of\nPassthrough. For more about Block and Passthrough, see the Working With\nCaptioning page.\nÂ· Auto-Block will automatically return you to Block mode when you start writing (so\nlong as you have not suspended output). This saves you having to manually go\nback to Block mode after switching to Passthrough.\nÂ· Select the type of encoder you are connecting to from the Encoder list. The Smart\nEncoder option will work for most encoders.\nÂ· Encoders can receive more than one set of captions at a time; the Caption\nChannel setting is the channel your captions will be sent on. The default is CC1.\nÂ· Mode Reiteration will send a Block command at the beginning of each line. If you\nare receiving garbage characters at the beginning/end of lines, try turning this\non.\nViewing Output Formats\nAfter you add an output format, you will be returned to the Realtime tab .

If you leave it at \"Default\" the current language is transmitted\nnormally. If you select any other language, that output will be transmitted\nafter Google Translate has a chance to translate it.\nYou can have multiple outputs in different languages and it will\ntranslate and output them separately.\n526 Eclipse Help\nYou will need internet access to use\nthis feature.\nTranslating into different languages\nis not limited to BridgeMobile or\nConnection Magic. It can be used with\nmany of Eclipse's output formats, even\nthose which use a serial connection. Also,\nforeign language users can translate into\nEnglish, or any language supported by\nGoogle Translate.\nSince the text can not possibly\nmatch the original formatting, the \"Force\nmargins\" option must be selected so that\nthe output system itself can re-wrap the\nparagraphs. Note that when you select a\nlanguage, it automatically turns on force\nmargins and then disables the checkbox\nso that you cannot turn it off.\nThe \"apply edits\" feature in the\nBridge/Mobile protocol must be turned\noff so that the software does not attempt\nto send non-translated text to the\nviewers.\nLanguage translation cannot be\ndone word-by-word. Instead, the output\nsystem will wait until it has collected an\nentire unit of meaning and then will\ntranslate the entire unit. When the\ntranslation is received from Google\n(hopefully within a fraction of a second if\nyour Internet is good enough) then the\nresult is transmitted to the output\nsystem. In order to make this work, you\nmust set the output \"Flush Word Delay\" to an arbitrarily large number such\nas 1000000.\nA \"unit of meaning\" is determined partly by the user and partly by the\nsoftware.\nBy default, the only divisions are whole paragraphs. If you leave that as\nthe default, the time between when you write something and when your\nviewers see it could be very long. However, you can also use the {FLUSH}\ncommand to force the output system to immediately translate what you have\nwritten since the last unit.\nFor that reason, it is strongly recommended that you define your\nterminal punctuation as {.}{FLUSH} and {?}{FLUSH} when using this\nfeature. You may also decide that {;}{FLUSH} and {:}{FLUSH} are\nappropriate.\nRealtime 527\nCommas are another story. {,}{FLUSH} is only appropriate for commas\nthat separate whole phrases or clauses, but not when separating items on a\nlist. For example, if you write \"I went to the store, not the bakery.\" you could\nuse a {,}{FLUSH} entry between those phrases and you are very likely to get\na sensible translation. However, you would NOT want to use a {,}{FLUSH}\nentry to write \"I purchased cake, pie, and bread that day.\" because it breaks\nup a sentence in a way that could lead to problems with tense, plurals,\ngender mismatches, etc.\nSimilar issues occur with conjunctions. \"{FLUSH}and\" might work in\nsome circumstances and not others.\nFor these situations, you can either create special versions of the\nentries that contain {FLUSH}, or you can simply write a {FLUSH} stroke as\nmost captioners do, and hit it frequently when there is a logical separation of\nideas, even within a single sentence, so that the result translation gets to the\nviewers as fast as possible.\nIf you wish to test the effectiveness of partial sentence translations, try\ntaking some sample sentences and feeding them to Google Translate in your\nfavorite browser. Then see what happens if you translate that sentence vs.\nwhat happens if you translate the sentence in multiple parts. If you are\ntranslating into a language you do not speak, you can test the effectiveness\nby taking the translated results and having Google Translate translate them\nback into English. That will give you a way to compare the effectiveness of\nwhole sentences vs. fragments and will give you an idea of where you can\nrealistically make divisions; note that different languages will have different\nquirks with regard to this issue.\nYou could also experiment with small Flush Word Delay values which\nwould automatically flush the translation when you paused writing for a\nmoment, but this could lead to extremely strange translation results if you\never paused for long enough in the middle of a thought.\n15.11 Eclipse Steno Link\nWorking With ECLIPSE\nSTENOLINK\nRELATES TO: Output Formats , Working With\na Scopist , Working With Realtime\nOutput , Global , Connection Magic ,\nWorking With Realtime , Working With\nDictionaries .\n520\n496\n519 326 532\n483\n672\n528 Eclipse Help\nEclipse StenoLink allows a scopist to edit a realtime transcript remotely, via a\ncable connection or via the Internet.\nWhen using Eclipse StenoLink, two separate translations are performed. The\nsteno is translated against the reporter's dictionary on the reporter's computer, as\nalways. The steno is then sent to the scopist's computer, where it is translated a\nsecond time. This requires the scopist to have the reporter's main dictionary, as well\nas any other dictionaries being used in this job.\nAny globals made by a scopist using Eclipse StenoLink will be sent back to\nthe reporter's computer, as if they had been performed there. So not only can the\nscopist edit a job in realtime, the scopist can also improve the reporter's translation\nrate, and build the reporter's dictionaries.\nScopist Setup\n1. The scopist must have up-to-the-minute copies of all dictionaries that the\nreporter intends to use in the job.\n2. The scopist must go to the dictionaries dialog , and assign these\ndictionaries to the same slots that the reporter has them in.\n3. On the Input tab , the scopist must set their writer type to Eclipse\nStenoLink.\n4. On the Input tab , the scopist must set Realtime From to COM port if\nthey are connected to the reporter via cable, or TCP/IP if they are connecting via\nthe Internet.\nReporter Setup\n1. The reporter must give the reporter up-to-the-minute copies of all dictionaries\nthat will be used in the job.\n2. The reporter must set up an Output Format . Select \"Eclipse StenoLink\" from\nthe Output Format drop-down list, and set Comm Device to either COM Port (for\na cable connection) or TCP/IP (for a connection via Internet).\nConnecting Via Cable\nIf the reporter and scopist computers are to be connected via COM port, the\nsetup is the same as it would be for realtime output .\nIn the Output Format , the reporter selects COM Port from the Comm Device\ndrop-down list, and then clicks the Setup button to open the COMM Setup dialog.\nThe reporter then sets Baud Rate to 9600, and sets Port to the COM port number\nthat is being used for output.\n483\n326\n955\n226 227\n226 227\n520\n519\n520\n947\n484\nRealtime 529\nThe scopist goes to the Input tab , sets Realtime From to COM Port, and\nthen clicks the Setup button to the right. This opens the COMM Setup dialog,\nwhere the scopist sets Baud Rate to 9600, and sets COM port to the number of the\nCOM port on their computer that the cable is connected to. If you're not sure what\nyour COM port number is, here's how to determine it .\nConnecting Via Internet\nAfter performing all the steps in Reporter Setup above, the reporter sets the\nComm Device in Output Formats to TCP/IP, and then clicks the Setup button at\nright. The dialog will ask you to add an Internet Address, and then a Port number.\nTo determine your Internet address:\n1. In Windows, Click Start, and then click Run.\n2. Type command and then press Enter. A DOS prompt will appear.\n3. At the DOS prompt, type ipconfig and then press Enter.\n4. Several lines of information will appear. You are looking for the line \"IP\nAddress.\" It will look something like this:\n5. Make a note of your IP Address. In the above graphic, \"192.168.1.2\" is the IP\nAddress. This is the number you will enter into Eclipse. NOTE: Depending on\nyour Internet service provider, this number may change from day to day. Be\nsure to check it each time before doing Eclipse StenoLink via TCP/IP.\n6. Type exit and then press Enter to leave the DOS prompt.\nGo back to Output Formats , click Setup, and enter this number into the\ndialog that appears:\n226 227\n947\n484\n528\n520\n520\n530 Eclipse Help\nYou will then be asked to enter a port number. If you're not sure, enter 21. If you\nare unable to connect to the scopist, ask your network administrator or Internet\nservice provider to suggest a port number.\n7. Eclipse prompts for an optional username and password. (Some direct TCP-IP\nconnection systems such as Speche require typing a username and a password.)\nIn addition to automating the username/password sending when connecting, if\nthe connection is dropped, it will re-transmit the username and password when\nreconnecting. If you don't need a username and password, just leave it blank\nand hit OK.\nOnce all this is ready, the reporter must then tell the scopist their IP address and\nport number. The scopist goes to the Input tab , clicks the Setup button to the\nright of Realtime From , and enters the same information.\nStarting The Realtime Job\nOnce all the above settings are in place, the reporter and the scopist each starts\na realtime job, via Translate Notes or the Instant Realtime button.\nNOTE: The Eclipse Edit Station (a version of the software for scopists) can\nperform translations if their writer type is set to Eclipse StenoLink. Otherwise, the Edit\nStation still cannot translate notes or do realtime .\nAudio recording sent through StenoLink connection\nWARNING: If you are going to transmit audio through StenoLink, it is highly\nrecommended that you use a heavily compressed audio format such as GSM. PCM files\nare likely to be much too large to stream effectively.\nHere's how this works. Instead of having the audio be on-demand through the IP\nconnection, the reporter's computer sends ALL of the audio as it's recorded. The\nScopist's computer then ends up with a complete WAV file being updated every few\nseconds as the reporter's computer records it. Since it's a local copy of the file, the\nscopist's WAV file is even available after the scopist disconnects.\nCurrently, there's no handshaking or re-sending of lost data, so if the scopist\ncomputer misses something, it's missed. You can always get a complete copy of the\nWAV file from the reporter later. If the reporter starts recording for two minutes and\nthen the scopist hooks up, they will have missed two minutes of audio (and steno\nstrokes.)\n226\n227\n483 271 486\n269 483\nRealtime 531\nConnection Magic and StenoLink Sessions\nYou can also use Connection Magic as a communications device type with the\nStenoLink output format on the reporter's system when doing realtime. This allows\nyou to send realtime from a reporter to a scopist through the Internet session server.\nStart the realtime on the reporter's side first, filling in the information in the\nsession dialog as necessary. On the scopist's side, start a realtime job and you should\nget a list of available public sessions. If the reporter's session is not on the list, select\nthe \"[Join a session not listed]\" option and type the name instead.\nThis works almost identically to the way that StenoLink works across a raw TCPIP\nconnection except that it's much easier to get going. Also, globals are symmetrical.\nAny global that the scopist performs will show up on the reporter's computer, and any\nglobal that the reporter performs will show up on the scopist's computer.\nAs with StenoLink, it is recommended that you use a heavily compressed audio\nformat such as GSM. PCM files are likely to be much too large to stream effectively.\nVISUALIZERS:\nD3a - StenoLink\nD3a - StenoLink Setup\nvD5 - Remote Scoping\nvD6 - Shared Editing\nvD6a Shared Editing Tips\n532 Eclipse Help\n16\nConnection Magic and Team Editing\nConnection Magic and\nShared Editing (Team\nEditing)\nRELATES TO: StenoLink\nConnection Magic is the generic term for the Advantage Software\nconnection infrastructure that works through any network â local or internet.\nWhen you are translating a file, whether doing Realtime, or Tran and Edit,\nyou can use Connection Magic to connect with any number of users, to do\nshared editing, or to share your document with clients and others using\nBridge mobile, over an internet connection or a local network. You can set up\na portable wifi router, to set up a local connection that doesn't rely on the\ninternet. You can also use Connectify to turn your PC into a wifi hotspot so\nyou can connect to nearby devices and even share your internet connection.\nAs of Version 10, Connectify is built-in to Eclipse.\nÂ· To use Connection Magic, you must be connected to the internet or a\nLAN (Local Area Network), or use Connectify. Details on using\nConnection Magic on a LAN are in the Reference section .\nÂ· To begin a shared editing session with a scopist or other user, you\nmust have a document on the screen.\nÂ· If you choose output to Bridge Mobile, you will decide when you start\nthe session whether you will use the internet or LAN.\nConnection Magic Setup and Use\nOn the Tools menu/Connection Magic sub-menu, you will find four\nmenu choices for setting up and using Connection Magic:\n1. View connections - opens the Connection Magic dialog, which\ndisplays open connections.\nYou could also click the Connect button on the toolbar to open this\ndialog.\n2. Share current document - Opens the Session settings dialog -\nuse to start a session\n527\n723\nConnection Magic and Team Editing 533\n3. Edit shared document - displays a list of active sessions on the ASI\nserver - use to join a session\n4. Send message - opens a text box where you can type a message to\nbe sent to the other users logged in to the session. The message can\nbe longer than the box - it will wrap when it gets to the other user.\nTo begin a shared editing session with a scopist or other user, you must\nhave a document on the screen.\nGo to Tools/Connection Magic/Share current document, or click\nthe toolbar button:\nThe Session settings dialog will open.\n534 Eclipse Help\nConnection Magic and Team Editing 535\nYou can explicitly select whether you are starting a session on the\nInternet, the LAN, or both. (Team editing still must be one or the other. You\ncannot mix and match LAN and Internet editors in the same session. If you\nneed both, everyone must connect through the Internet.)\nIf you have LAN selected, you can optionally start up your own virtual\nhotspot on your computer using the ConnectifyMe software by simply\nspecifying a hotspot name and password. Users can use that hotspot to\nconnect their Bridge Mobile.\nYou can also start up the Connection Magic Local server automatically. If\nyou have the \"Host LAN\" checkbox turned on, Eclipse will automatically start\nup the LAN software, as well. (You should only uncheck this box if the\nConnection Magic Local software is already running on an independent server\nin the building, which is sometimes done by the IT managers in courthouses\nwhere reporters have LAN access. If Eclipse detects that there is already a\nLAN present, it will automatically hide this option.)\n536 Eclipse Help\nThe Connection Magic Local software runs in the background, and it is\ncontrolled directly by Eclipse â When you choose the LAN option Eclipse\nautomatically launches Connection Magic Local. It's also okay to launch\nConnection Magic Local before beginning.\nIf you Host a LAN connection for Bridge Mobile or for local Team Editing,\nEclipse will tell this service to start the LAN connection automatically. You will\nthen see the \"LAN\" indication in Eclipse, and the system tray icon will show\nan IP address if you hover over it (double-clicking will also copy the IP\naddress.)\nBecause Eclipse can automatically launch a wi-fi hotspot and password,\na communications session name and password, and runs the local LAN server\nwith IP address, you can find all of that information by going to\nTools/Connection Magic/View Connections, choose your host username\nand select Properties and Password.\nCheck the Share Internet option if you are also going to be connected\nto the Internet and wish to share your Internet connection with the other\nparticipants.\nThere will be a default Document name, which you can use or change.\nYou may note that when you select a Document name and hit OK you will see\na \"checking\" message. If you use a session name that's already in use, you\nwill get a message to that effect and you will have to change the name. You\ncannot accidentally enter someone else's session.\nYou can use an optional Persistent session name. See below for\ndetails.\nYou have the option to enter a Password, so only users who have the\npassword can connect to the session. If you check Publicly visible, the session\nwill appear to anyone who goes to \"Edit shared document.\" However, they\nwill need the password to join the session.\nIf you prefer, you can leave Publicly visible unchecked, and when the\nscopist goes to \"Edit shared document,\" they can select [Join a session not\nlisted], type in the name of your document, enter the password if there is\none, and click OK. Note: both the session name and password are case\nsensitive. Eclipse will permanently remember your choice for the Publicly\nvisible checkbox, until you change it.\nThe Room drop-down list lets you pick a room first, then pick a session\nfrom within that room. There are 8 rooms available. Reporters can select\n[auto] to automatically select the emptiest room, or can manually pick an\nagreed-upon room. Note that after using [auto], the reporter will see which\nroom the session was created in and can communicate that to viewers/editors\nalong with the name. Telling users \"Pick the Smith job in room 5\" greatly\nreduces the number of sessions listed, making it simpler for those connecting\nto find the session they wish to join.\n543\nConnection Magic and Team Editing 537\nLatency: When you click OK, Eclipse will do a very short bandwidth test\nto see what the average latency and speed are on your connection. The speed\nis the amount of data that can be transferred, and the latency is the amount\nof time it takes for the data to get from you to the server. These numbers\ncould be helpful for troubleshooting issues with bandwidth-intensive features\nsuch as Team Editing. The software will also automatically warn you if it\ndetects that you have a very slow or high-latency connection if you are\nattempting to share a live audio recording through the Team Editing feature,\nand it may recommend going to a higher compression audio format.\nIf you are outputting to Bridge Mobile, you will have the option to create\nan email link.\n538 Eclipse Help\nIf you have auto-Generate selected, then when you start a session,\nEclipse will copy links to the session, including the job name and password\nhash, into the clipboard. This will be used by people joining using a browser,\nnot the Bridge Mobile app.\nYou can then paste these links into an e-mail message, an SMS\nmessage, or any other communications message type of your choice to send\nto clients. They will only need to click on that link in order to join the session\nin Bridge Mobile using a browser.\nConnection Magic and Team Editing 539\nNote that if you are operating on a LAN, the user will need an alternate\nway to retrieve the link, such as through your Internet connection that you\nare sharing through your hotspot. They can retrieve the link through the\nInternet BEFORE joining the local wi-fi hotspot in order to join the session.\nTo retrieve the link during the session go to Tools/Connection\nMagic/View Connections and press the Get link button to recopy the link\nto your clipboard.\nClicking the Valid IDs button opens a text box where you can enter the\nemail address of anyone who should have access to the Bridge Mobile\nsession. If you enter emails here, users trying to log in with an email not on\nthe list will get an \"INVITATION NOT FOUND\" error.\nJoining a Shared Editing Session\nWhen looking for a session to join, you can put the cursor in the session\nname box and start typing letters. As soon as you type two or more letters,\nthe session list will start showing you ONLY the session names that CONTAIN\nthe sequence of text that you typed (expanding the appropriate rooms\nautomatically.) The session name doesn't have to start with that text. It can\nbe anywhere, including the middle of the name. So if you keep the default\nBR-JobName-etc. Template, you won't have to type the BR- part. So, for\nexample, if you typed âharâ in the session name, it might narrow the list\ndown to show sessions named âHarold vs Maudeâ and âBR-Harrisonâ or even\nâBR-Smith v Harvey.â As long as it contains the letters, it's match, which will\nnarrow the list very quickly and allow you to pick the one you need.\nThe \"connect\" function for connecting to a team editing session will\nupdate the list of sessions from the Internet every few seconds so that a new\nsession will show up in the list without your having to hit escape and re-issue\nthe \"edit shared document\" command.\nIn a Shared Editing Session\nWhile in a shared editing session, each user will see the cursor position\nand editing activity for every other person in the session. The other cursors\nwill have flags showing the names of the other users, so you can see where\nthey are editing.\nThe graphic below shows a side-by-side view of 2 users: the Reporter's\nscreen on the left, and the Scopist's screen on the right. As you can see, the\nscopist's cursor is visible on the reporter's screen, with a flag reading\n\"SCOPIST.\" On the scopist's screen, you can see the reporter's cursor, with a\nflag reading \"REPORTER.\"\n540 Eclipse Help\nWhenever any user performs a global of any kind, the session reflects\nthe edits as necessary, and the global itself will be entered into the\nappropriate dictionary on the other systems. In other words, if one user\nmakes a global and puts it into a job dictionary, it will be entered into the job\ndictionary for that job on all of the computers in the editing session.\nNote: Reporter and scopist should be using the same Main dictionary.\nIf an editor selects a conflict, the grammar AI will be placed in the\nreporter's dictionary, if applicable. If the editor deletes a word from or adds a\nword to the spelling dictionary, it will be added to the reporter's spelling\ndictionary, as well.\nIf you select Tools/Connection Magic/Send message or click the\ntoolbar button, any user in the session can send a message to the\nother users in the session, by\nType a message and hit [enter] and the other users will see it in the\ninfobar or in the connections dialog (see below).\nWhen you are in a shared session, you can see who is in the session, as\nwell as any messages that have been sent, by going to Tools/Connection\nMagic/View connections, which opens the Connection Magic dialog. Each\neditor is listed, along with the page and line number they are on. The list will\ninclude Bridge/Bridge Mobile users as well. The dialog box and the list of\nusers within the dialog are resizable by clicking a dragging the lower borders.\nAt the bottom of this dialog is an edit box, where you can type a\nmessage and hit Enter to send it to everyone connected to the session. The\nchat log will now be saved under sessionname_chatlog.txt (regardless of the\ndocument name) in each user's jobs folder when the session is closed.\n(For a private message, see below)\nConnection Magic and Team Editing 541\nIf you click the Properties button, it opens the Session user info\ndialog.\nClicking the Color button allows you to select a color for that user's\nchat window messages. This selection also determines the color of the\neditor's name in the flag that appears on the editing screen, and in the info\nbar.\nYou can also click Find to locate where another user in the team editing\nprocess is in the document.\n542 Eclipse Help\nYou can use the Make Host button to transfer host status to another\nuser. Select the user you want to make the host, click the Properties button,\nand press the Make Host button and that will turn that user into the new\nhost for the document. On each user's screen, they should now see (host)\nnext to that user name. The previous host is now free to leave the session\nand it will stay active and allow the other users to continue editing without\nhaving to start a new session. Making a different team member the host is\nespecially useful when working with three or more editors when the editors\nwish to keep working in the Team Editing session, but the reporter host\nwishes to disconnect and shut down. If the reporter attempts to close the\nsession when two or more scopists are still working on the document, the\nsoftware will suggest that they should transfer host status to one of the\nscopists before stopping the translation so that they can continue working\ninstead of getting kicked out of the document.\nYou can Remove someone from the session. When you click this\nbutton, they will immediately be disconnected and will not be permitted back\ninto the session.\nYou can type a message in the Private message: text box, and click\nthe Send button or hit Enter to send it to the selected user. The message will\nappear with \"(Private from [username])\" in the message on the recipient's\nscreen.\nClicking the Password button will open a dialog where you can find the\npassword you choose for the session, as well as the session name, IP\naddress, and the name and password of the hotspot if you have created one.\nYou can also see who is in the session along with the messages that\nhave been sent on the info bar, if you have checked Connections in View\ntoggles. The list of editors in a shared editing session will include what page\nand line number each editor is on.\nConnection Magic and Team Editing 543\nSessions persist\nWhen creating a Connection Magic session of any type, you can supply\nan optional \"Persistent Session Name\" which is separate from the \"Document\nName.\" The document name will still be filled in automatically with a\nsuggestion, and will also be used as the session name if the session name is\nleft empty.\nIf you supply a session name, that will stay on the server even after the\ndocument has finished. You can use the same session name (and password)\nfor successive days, even though the document name changes. The\nConnection Magic start session dialog will explicitly state that it is the\npersistent session name, and that using a persistent session name that is\ndifferent from the document name is entirely optional.\nThe same name and password will appear in the dialog the next time\nyou start a session. Remember to clear it or change it if you want a whole\nnew session. A new document will always be started, so this could be a\nconvenient way to dramatically speed up the connection process for throwdowns\non a day-to-day basis.\nNote that these persistent session names could be used for all of the\ndocuments in a continuing case (\"FL-1234\") or a branded connection for a\nreporting firm (\"Smith Reporting A\") or a convenience connection for an\nindividual (\"JTHORNE\") and be reused over and over as many times as\nnecessary.\n544 Eclipse Help\nAlso, because a persistent session sticks around even after the original\nowner has disconnected, that means that a second provider can join in as an\nalternate provider by supplying the same name and password to continue. It\nis not necessary for the second provider to join before the first one\ndisconnects (though it's probably still better to do it that way for the sake of\nrapid continuity.)\nSession log\nEach Connection Magic session you host, whether it's a Bridge Mobile\nsession or a Team Editing session, will keep a log of changes to the attendees\nin a file with the session name_log.txt. This can be opened from the Eclipse\nfile manager or Windows explorer. Any changes to the list of attendees will be\nnoted with a timestamp so you can tell exactly who was present at any point\nduring the session.\nWav files in a shared session\nIf the Reporter's document has a WAV file for that job, anyone else\nsharing the document will be able to play the audio, as well. Users can just\nhit the Play button and receive the audio through the Internet connection\nfrom host document. Note: any audio you have played while connected will\nbe available off-line if you later view the file while not connected to the\nreporter.\nOpus files in a shared session\nAn opus file is a data stream that never changes. When starting a\nsharing session, the session will transmit the entire .opus file as it exists\ncurrently. That means that sharing an existing job will start by uploading the\nwhole file. Sharing realtime will only have to upload a few seconds to start\nand from then on will update whenever new data appears in the file every few\nseconds.\nEditors will receive the entire file from beginning to end. With Opus files\nat 25mb/hour, this should not cause any issues.\nWhat else is Shared in a Team Editing Session?\nThe entire non-content portion of the documents is transmitted:\nDocument settings, Paragraph settings, job variables, speaker table, job\ndictionary list, document statistics, everything. Because of this, keep in mind\nthat if one editor modifies the document settings, they're immediately\ntransmitted to everybody. If two users edit the document settings at the\nsame time, these changes could cross in transit and only one change would\nbe preserved during reconciliation.\nData mining to improve Eclipse\nConnection Magic and Team Editing 545\nWhen you are connected to the Eclipse server, it collects data: conflict\nselections, grammar data, spelling dictionary changes, additions, and\ndelections, and briefs. It does not collect personal data, and does not\ndownload dictionaries or jobs. This data is used to improve the performance\nof Eclipse.\nWarning messages for shared editors when host\ndisconnects or lags\nEclipse will warn the editors when the reporter's system is either\nlagging behind or is disconnected. When scopists receive this message, they\nshould stop editing that document temporarily since those edits may not\nstick. (They can edit other documents while waiting, if desired.) Once the\nreporter's system catches up, another message will appear letting the\nscopists know that it is safe to resume editing. Server messages will appear\nfor 30 seconds.\nWarning for shared editors when internet disconnects\nIf a scopist is in the a team editing session and their Internet\nconnection disconnects, they will get a bright background color warning to\nstop editing.\nEditing a file from a shared session when not connected.\nAfter a shared editing session, the scopist will have a transcript file\nnamed sessionname.ecl. The scopist can edit it while off-line. Note that it will\nbe the new authoritative version of the file. For example, if the scopist is\nproducing the final proofread copy while the reporter is working on another\njob, the scopists' version will be the final copy. However, if the scopist rejoins\na live editing session under that same name, their version of the\ntranscript will revert to the reporter's version of the file.\nIf the scopist does want to have another live editing session with the\nreporter, they can do it by opening the file they edited while off-line, then\nsharing that version from the scopist side, and have the reporter join in. That\nway, the reporter's version will change to the scopist's version. (If you keep\nthe default session name, the reporter will end up with a session named EDED-\nJobname.)\nIf you are a scopist in an editing team and a document reconciliation is\nrequired due to a simultaneous edit or a connection issue, it will mark any\nparagraph that had to be reverted to the reporter's version in a different\ncolor. You may want to double-check these paragraphs to see if any edits did\nnot make it from the scopist to the reporter.\nVISUALIZERS:\nD6 - Shared Editing\nD6a - Shared Editing Tips\nC7 - Track Co-Editors\n546 Eclipse Help\nD6 - Connection Magic Fully Integrated\nD6d - Connection Magic Users Dialog\nD6b - Connection Magic Local\nD6c - Connection Magic Link\nD6d - Connection Magic Users Dialogue\nD4d -Multi-Channel Audio\nL5e - Vox Shared Editing\n16.1 TeamEditing Warning Colors\nTeam Editing Warning\nColors\nThe User Settings/Display/Color selections include four separate\nTeam Editing warning colors that can be modified to present different\nbackground color warnings for editing status:\nConnection Magic and Team Editing 547\nTeam Edit Reconciliation â indicates that a discrepancy has been\ndetected somewhere in the document and the document is reconciling with\nthe reporter.

The location of\nthis folder can be changed in Advanced User Settings .\nVISUALIZERS:\nC2 - Blocks Folder\nF7 - Autoincludes\nF7a - AUTOBLOCK\n17.2 Blanks\nWorking With BLANKS\nRELATES TO: Working With Block Files , Add\nBlank .\nBlanks (also known as blank fields, scan fields, or just fields) are used in the\ncreation of block files .\nWhen creating a block file, whenever you come to a place in the block file where\nthe information may vary -- such as the name of the deponent -- insert a blank at\nthat point.\nThen, after you read (Alt+R) the block file into a transcript, you can fill in\nthe blank with the information for that transcript.\nTips On Using Blanks\n392\n275\n108\n548\n551\n548\n551\n392\n561\n550 Eclipse Help\nÂ· Space around a blank the same way you would space around the text that goes in\nit. Any punctuation goes immediately before/after the field; otherwise it is\npreceeded and followed by a space. For example:\nÂ· Only use fields for information that can change. Text that never changes should\nsimply be typed into the block file.\nÂ· Fields can be set up to select from a list of choices, adjust their size, automatically\nfill based on choices from earlier in the document, See the page on adding\nblanks for a full list of field behaviors and when to use them.\nBlanks in Dictionary Entries\nBlanks may be included in dictionary entries. This allows you to create brief\nblurbs that contain blanks, without having to create block files for them.\nThe syntax for a blank is as follows:\n{FL:Fieldsyntax}\nFieldsyntax is a string of text that declares your preferences for the behavior of\nthis blank. If you're not sure what each one does, see the page on adding blanks .\nÂ· ^ will make the field variable size.\nÂ· D will delete the line if empty.\nÂ· C will capitalize the contents of the field.\nÂ· L will make this a last field.\nÂ· R will right-flush the field.\nÂ· P will prompt for contents (use this item only with a variable)\nÂ· < followed by a filename will use that file as a list file .\nÂ· | followed by a variable name will create a variable.\n551\n548\n552\n556\nBlock files 551\nÂ· \" followed by text will create a field label.\nFor example, a dictionary entry for a field that uses the variable size, delete if\nempty, capitalize contents, and a list file reference would look like this:\n{FL:^DC<listfile}\nFor the {FL:} dictionary syntax to work, you must have the following entry in\nyour metadictionary :\n{FL:*}={/\"%/?TXF}\nVISUALIZERS: G2 - Blanks Overview\nM13 - Auto-Magic Fields\n17.3 Add Blank\nAdd Blank\nCtrl+A/hyperkey Shift+E\nor Edit/Insert/Add blank..\nRELATES TO: Working With Blanks ,\nWorking With Block Files .\nInserts a blank field into the transcript at the cursor location. Blank\nfields are used in block files . The Add blank dialog will appear:\n850\n549\n548\n548\n552 Eclipse Help\nEach of the items in the Add Blank dialog has a different meaning, and\nlends itself to a different usage in your title pages.\nÂ· Field Label. A piece of text that appears in the field before it is filled in.\nThis is not required, and is aesthetic only, but it makes the title page a lot\neasier to understand.\nÂ· Adjustable. If checked, the field will expand or contract as needed to the\nsize of the text entered into it. You should always check Adjustable, unless\nthere is text to the right of the field that can be pulled out of alignment,\nsuch as the edge of a \"birdcage\" on the title page. (Another way to do a\nbirdcage is to use the \"Case caption\" paragraph type.) You can also use\nnon-adjustable fields, or tab stops, to align data in columns.\nÂ· Field Size. If your field is not adjustable, this is the maximum number of\ncharacters the field will take. If you are using the Adjustable option, this\nsetting is irrelevant. Note that a non-adjustable field has a minimum size\nlimited by the command text required by the other options selected for the\nfield. For example, a label of \"First name\" would require the field to be at\nleast 10 characters longer than an empty field.\nÂ· Variable. If multiple fields are to contain the same information (such as\nthe deponent's name), enter the same variable into each field, and they\nwill all fill in when the first one is filled in. For example, if you create three\ndifferent fields with WITNAME as the variable, when you enter the\ndeponent's name into the first WITNAME field, all WITNAME fields will fill in\nwith that name. (Fields that do not have this variable will not be affected;\nlikewise, more than one variable may be in use at a time.) You can directly\nedit the contents of field variables by using the Tools/Job variables\nfunction (Shift+Alt+V). Job variables can be edited manually, and copied\nBlock files 553\nand pasted between jobs. Writing a section of a job will copy the job\nvariables to the new excerpt.\n. You can use your speaker table in connection with form field\nvariables:\nSpeakers to Fields: When starting a translation, you may want to enter\nin your standard speaker designations. For example, your speaker table\nmight have SPK01 and SPK02 as master speaker names to go with the\ndictionary entries such as STPHAO = {S:SPK01}. If you use those exact\nsame speaker table master speaker names as form field variables, that data\nwill be filled in automatically. If you enter MR. SMITH for SPK01 in the\nspeaker table, then a form field with SPK01 as the form field variable will\nautomatically be filled in with MR. SMITH, as well.\nFields to Speakers: In order to create the association between speaker\nnames and form fields, use a technique very similar to using the NUM, ALPHA\nor AUTO suffixes. The SPK suffix indicates that the current form field is a\nspeaker. If a variable end with SPK and you have âprompt for contentsâ\nturned on, then whenever you fill in the field, whether manually or from a list\nfile, it will open the speaker table with the contents of the field already typed\nin. To assign it to a speaker, use the cursor down key to the appropriate row\nand hit Enter.\nÂ· Prompt For Contents. If you are using a variable, this item will give you\nthe opportunity to confirm each variable field before it is filled in. If a field\nwith a variable is to be filled in, the Fill In Blank dialog will appear.\nPress Enter to accept the data already assigned to that variable; if you\nwant different data, enter it. (If you are not using a Variable, the Prompt\nfor Contents checkbox has no effect.)\nThis option is most useful in situations where you wish to use the same\ninformation in multiple places within the same form, but you intend to have\nmultiple instances of the form in the same document, each with different\nrepeated data, such as an \"exhibit marked\" form, where the exhibit number\nmay appear several times, but should change the next time the form is used.\nIf the variable name ends in NUM and you type a number into it, it will\nautomatically increment to the next value when prompting. Note that this\nonly happens when the system prompts you for the value, giving you an\nopportunity to change the number. If several consecutive fields containing\nthe variable are not set to prompt for the value, they will all get filled in with\nthe same value, which is especially appropriate for block files where the value\nwill be used both in the text and on one or more automatic index lines.\nYou can also use ALPHA at the end of a form field variable name to\nauto-increment letters, so after filling in A for the first exhibit, the next one\nwill automatically come up B. These two features can be used together, so\nyou might have PLAINTNUM and DEFALPHA and they would increment\nseparately. After reaching Z, it will start over at AA. After reaching ZZ, it will\nstart over at AAA, etc.\n561\n554 Eclipse Help\nSimilarly, you can use AUTO at the end of a form field variable, and it\nwill auto-increment either one (alpha or numeric). A variable such as EXAUTO\nor PLFAUTO would count 1, 2, 3 or A, B, C depending on whatever was last\ntyped in.\nFinally, you can simply use the word SORT on an index line rather than\nALPHASORT or NUMSORT. Just plain SORT will sort according to whatever the\ncontents are. If it contains any digits at all, it will be sorted by the numeric\nvalue. Otherwise, it will be sorted in alphabetical order.\nÂ· Delete Line If Empty. If this field is unused, entering nothing into the\nfield will cause the entire line to disappear. This is useful for\nplaintiff/defendant section of the title page, where you may have individual\nlines for multiple plaintiffs/defendants, and if some of the fields are not\nused, some of the lines should be deleted.\nÂ· Last Field. If checked, the Fill In Blank process will stop at this field,\nrather than continue to the next field. It is useful to check this for the very\nlast field of a form so that you can fill in the entire form in one sequence,\nbut you don't want it to move to the next form when it's done. Another way\nto only fill in some fields is to use the Scan to unresolved function,\nCtrl+T, which will stop on the next empty form field and request that you\nfill it in, but it will not advance to the next one automatically after that.\nÂ· Capitalize Contents. If checked, any text entered into this field will\nautomatically be ALL CAPS once you hit [enter].\nÂ· Right Flush Contents. If checked, the contents of this field will right-align\ninstead of left-aligning. Some title page designs call for this. Note that in\norder for this to work you must have the Adjustable checkbox turned off,\nbecause it right-aligns the data by inserting spaces before it to fill the\nentire available field size.\nÂ· Change font. If checked, then once you're finished with the other options\nand you hit OK to create the field, it will automatically be highlighted and\nthe font change dialog will appear, allowing you to select any font/attribute\nyou like for the field without extra steps.\nÂ· Use List File. If a filename is entered here, that file will be used to\ngenerate a list of choices. Use this option when the field lends itself to\npicking from a list, such as days of the week, months, or county names.\nWhen you fill in the blank, you will be offered this list of choices, rather\nthan having to type the entire text.\nÂ· Browse. Allows you to select a list file from the file dialog .\n561\n969\nBlock files 555\nÂ· Mathematical formula. Allows you to enter a formula that will determine\nhow a form field is filled in mathematically. You can also have a variable\nname for that field so that after the calculation is performed, the result is\nstored in a variable for later use.\nThe mathematical formula parser understands the following operators:\nÂ· + addition\nÂ· - subtraction\nÂ· * multiplication\nÂ· / division\nÂ· ( ) precedence. Example: (7-2)*3 produces 15, but 7-(2*3) produces 1 %\nmodulus (remainder). NOT percentage!\nIt also understands the following functions:\nÂ· Abs - absolute value\nÂ· Sqrt - square root\nÂ· Log - natural logarithm\nÂ· Log10 - base-ten logarithm\nÂ· Sin - sine\nÂ· Cos - cosine\nÂ· Tan - tangent\nÂ· ASin - arcsine\nÂ· ACos - arccosine\nÂ· ATan - arctangent\nFor the most part, you're going to be using this on billing pages and for\nscopists invoices, etc., and you won't need the advanced math, but you\nmight find a use for some of these functions. For example, you can do\ncalculations for compound interest without an iterative function by using\nlogarithms.\nFinally, the formula parser can use variable names in place of numbers,\nwhich includes any variables you have created and filled in in the job. For\nexample, if you have created a form field containing a variable PAGERATE\nand filled 2.75 into that field, you can use PAGERATE in a formula calculation.\nThe following variable names are built-in, and will be filled in\nautomatically with the appropriate value:\nÂ· PAGES - the total number of pages in the document\nÂ· PAGE - the current page number at the cursor position\nÂ· YEAR, MONTH, DAY, HOUR, MINUTE, SECOND -- elements of the date and\ntime from the note file. It will use the timecode from the current location in\nthe transcript. Note that in Realtime, these will be the current date/time.\nAn example of use:\nLet's say you want to calculate a bill for the total number of pages in a\ntranscript minus the form pages.\n556 Eclipse Help\nOn the last page of your appearances, you put a comment line\ncontaining a formfield with a variable FORMPAGES, and a formula containing\nonly PAGE. This will calculate and store the page number of the last form\npage before the content starts.\nAt the end of the file, you have a billing page with form field containing\na variable PAGERAGE which you fill in manually.\nIn the invoice, you have a total bill form field containing the formula\n(PAGES - FORMPAGES) * PAGERATE.\n17.4 List Files\nWorking With LIST\nFILES\nRELATES TO: Working With Blanks ,\nA list file is a standard text file that contains a list of possible choices\nfor a blank field .\nIt is good practice to use a list file with a field when the field lends itself\nto a small, pre-determined list of choices: days of the week, months of the\nyear, different counties you may work in, etc.\nCreating a List File\n1. Create a new text file. Be sure that it is stored in the Blocks folder.\n2. Type a list with one of the items you want to be the choices in your\nscan field on each separate line in the file. When filling in the form, you\nwill be asked to select from that list. You can select items using the\nmouse or keyboard. Include one choice on each line. Like this:\n549\n694\n549\n1036\nBlock files 557\n3. Close the file.\nAssigning A List File To A Field\n1. Create a blank field .\n2. Enter the name of the list file into the Use List File text box. You may\neither type the filename directly into the box, or click the Browse\nbutton and select it from the file dialog.\nSorting\nIf you put a comment line at the top of the list containing the word\n\"SORT\" in all caps, the list will appear sorted as you fill in the blanks (but not\nwhen you are editing the list file).\nSelection Criteria\n945\n551\n558 Eclipse Help\nBy default, you select an item from a list file by typing part of its name.\nAlternatively, you can create shortcut keys to be used when you select an\nitem from the list. They allow you to select items quickly when filling in\nblanks. To designate shortcut keys as you create list items: type what you\nwant to use as the shortcut, then the at symbol @ , then type the list\nentry. This is most useful when items in a list are very similar to each other\n(such as March and May).\nTo do this, precede the item with the selection criteria you want to use,\nand then the @ sign. Like this:\nYou may now type 1 to select Monday, 2 to select Tuesday, etc.\nThe selection criteria can be letters or numbers. For example, you may\nwant to use an attorney's last name as a selection criteria:\nNote that you can use the _ literal character command in the list\nprocessor, which will allow you to put in things like jthorne_@eclipsecat.com,\nand it won't see the \"@\" as a signal to make \"jthorne\" a shortcut string for\nthe list. This also works with the plus sign.\nMulti-Line List Files\nBlock files 559\nA list file may be used to fill in more than one field at a time. This\ntechnique is most commonly used on the Appearances page, where the\nnames and addresses of attorneys are given.\nTo create a multi-line list file, type each piece of text into the same\nparagraph, separated by plus signs. Like this:\nThere are three pieces of information here: \"Advantage Software\", \"925\nCentral Parkway\", and \"Stuart, Florida 34994\", separated by plus signs. Each\nof these items will go into a separate field.\nNote that the text wraps to the next line. This is normal. Each paragraph\nshould contain one set of information.\nTo use a multi-line list file, create as many blanks the information calls\nfor. In the above example, you would need three blanks. Then, assign only\nthe first blank to use the list file. When you fill in the first blank, the\nremaining blanks will fill in automatically.\nIf the number of blanks you will need may vary, create the maximum\nnumber of blanks you will need, and use the Delete Line If Empty attribute.\nAlso, at some point in the list file entry, include one additional plus for each\nfield you will not be using. For example, if an address is only three lines long\nbut you need to create four fields (to account for other attorneys who have\nfour-line addresses), the entry would read:\nAdvantage Software++925 Central Parkway+Stuart Florida, 34994\nSelecting from list files\n560 Eclipse Help\nThe list file selection dialog contains a number of choices.\nÂ· The Edit button allows you to edit the list file before selecting an item. This\nbutton opens the list file document and escapes out of the fill-in-the-blanks\nprocess. It jumps to the currently highlighted item on the list. Once you\nare done editing the list, close it and you will see that your cursor is still in\nthe original document in the appropriate location to continue filling in\nblanks. Just hit Ctrl+E or whatever keystroke you normally use for filling in\nblanks to continue.\nÂ· The Sort button arranges the entries in the list file alphabetically.\nÂ· The Details button will show you the additional field details for the\ncurrently highlighted list item\nÂ· If the list file includes shortcut keys, you can type the item s shortcut to\nselect it.\nÂ· You can create a new list entry by typing it in the editing field and clicking\nAdd. You can then select the item and press Enter. Note that you can even\nadd entries containing the + sign to indicate multiple fields worth of data\nMerging and sorting items from multiple list files, and\ndeleting duplicates\nIf you work with block files containing long lists of attorneys or other\nitems you use with the form fields feature, you may need a way to sort the\nlists. You can do this by putting a comment line at the top of the list with the\nword SORT in the comment, as described above. But if you have two or more\nlists that you wish to sort and combine together, you can place the cursor on\nthe \"SORT\" comment line and hit Read block (Alt+R) and read the second\nblock into the first, and Eclipse will detect the fact that they are sorted lists\nand will ask the following question:\nDelete duplicates and re-sort list? (yes / no)\nBlock files 561\nIf you answer yes, the second list will be merged with the first and\nduplicates will be eliminated. The list will then be sorted and regenerated in\nthe file.\nInserting fields during translation\nYou can include {FL:FieldSyntax} in a dictionary entry to insert a field\nduring translation. See the metadictionary sections of the Reference Guide\n, and the Metadictionary help file for further details.\n17.5 Fill Blank\nFill in the Blanks\nCtrl+E/hyperkey E or\nProduction/Fill in blanks..\nMoves the cursor to the next blank , and opens a dialog that prompts the user\nto fill in the blank.\nSelecting From A List\nIf the blank has been designed to use a list file , a dialog will appear offering\nthe list of choices you made:\nTo select a choice from this list, you may do any of the following:\n797\n850\n549\n556\n562 Eclipse Help\nÂ· Begin typing the desired item. Once you have typed enough to uniquely identify it,\nit will be highlighted. Then, press Enter.\nÂ· Use the arrow keys to highlight the desired item, and then press Enter.\nÂ· Double-click the desired item.\nNote: if a list file uses selection criteria , you would type that instead of the\nitem itself. In the above example, you would type 1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, etc.\nIf you want to enter something that is not a choice in the list, you may simply\ntype it and then press Enter. If you want to add it to the list file (so it will be a choice\nin the future), click the Add button before pressing Enter.\nThe Edit button will open the list file, where it can be edited. This button opens\nthe list file document and escapes out of the fill-in-the-blanks process. Once you are\ndone editing the list, close it and you will see that your cursor is still in the original\ndocument in the appropriate location to continue filling in blanks. Just hit Ctrl+E or\nwhatever keystroke you normally use for filling in blanks to continue.\nThe Sort button will arrange the entries in the list file alphabetically. Otherwise,\nthey will appear in the same order they were in the list file.\nIf this is a multi-line list file , the Details button will allow you to view the\nentire entry.\nThe Back and Next buttons will allow you to move to the previous or following\nblank, without filling this one in.\nFilling A Blank\nIf this field does not use a list file, the Fill In Blank dialog will appear:\nSimply type the desired text, and then press Enter.\nThe Back and Next buttons will allow you to move to the previous or following\nblank, without filling this one in.\nOther Blank Behaviors\nInserting Special Characters, Time and Date: You can insert special\ncharacters while filling in the blanks, using the Ctrl+W function just as you would\nduring globaling or editing. To insert the date and/or time while filling in the blanks,\nhit Ctrl+D to bring up the insert time/date dialog box. You can choose any of the\nexisting formats or create your own, and you can modify the date and time values\nthat appear, as well.\n557\n558\nBlock files 563\nThe editing action Scan To Non-Resolved (Ctrl+T or hyperkey T) will also\nstop on blanks.\nWhen you fill in a blank, you will automatically be moved to the next blank,\nunless the Last Field option was checked when the blank was created.\nIf you make a mistake filling in a blank, you can simply edit it as text, or move\nthe cursor above the blank and fill it in again. However, you will always have to type\nthe desired text (you will not be offered a list).\nBlanks can also have certain behaviors, such as adjusting for size, capitalizing,\nand filling in other blanks with the same information. These behaviors are determined\nwhen the blank is created. See the page on adding a blank for a description of\nblank options, and when to use them.\nVISUALIZERS: G2 - Blanks Overview\nM13 - Auto-Magic Fields\n339\n554\n551\n564 Eclipse Help\n18 Automatic Indexing\nWorking With INDEXING\nIndexing Overview\nTo create an automatic index in Eclipse, you must:\nÂ· Insert an index line into the transcript for each item you want to appear in the\nindex.\nÂ· Have correct paragraph margin settings in place.\nÂ· Generate the index.\nInsert An Index Line\nYou can insert an index line into a transcript via an index line print\ncommand , or by using the Insert Index Item dialog.\nWhichever method you use, you will be creating an index line that contains the\nfollowing five components:\nÂ· Index Name. Determines which index this entry goes into. For example, you could\nhave an index of EXHIBITS and an index of WITNESSES.\nÂ· Index Item. The text that appears in the index. Usually this is an exhibit number,\nor the name of a witness or attorney.\nÂ· Paragraph Style. The paragraph style that is being used to control the margins and\nappearance of the index. See the next section for details.\nÂ· Body Text or Description. Optional. This item is most often used when you are\nindexing both the exhibit number and a description. The exhibit number would be\nthe Index Item, and the description would be the Body Text.\nÂ· Location Format. A code that indicates whether you are placing a page, line, or\nvolume number, and where it is being placed:\no {P} places a page number.\no {L} places a line number.\no {V} places a volume number.\no {TR:X} means to place this item at tab stop X. For example, {TR:1} would be tab\nstop #1, the left-most tab stop in the Paragraph Style you are using. (Note: you\ncan also use {TL:X} or {TC:X}, to left-align or center-align this item.)\nA location format entry consists of a tab stop item, followed by what is being\nplaced there. Here are some examples:\nÂ· {TR:1}{P} will place the page number at tab stop 1.\nÂ· {TR:3}{P} will place the page number at tab stop 3.\nÂ· {TR:1}{P}{TR:2}{L} will place the page number at tab stop 1, and the line\nnumber at tab stop 2.\n366 568\nAutomatic Indexing 565\nÂ· {TR:1}{V}{TR:2}{P} will place the volume number at tab stop 1, and the page\nnumber at tab stop 2.\nÂ· {TR:1}Pg. {P} will place the text \"Pg. \" followed by the page number, at tab stop\n1.\nThe five components of an index line are separated by pipes:\nThe pipe symbol | is a vertical line. On most keyboards, you type Shift+\\\n(Shift+backslash) to produce it.\nThe In: text is inserted automatically by Eclipse. (This indicates an index line, as\nopposed to some other print command .)\nNote that an index line can wrap if it is longer than one line. This is normal.\nIf you are not using one component of the index line, such as the Body Text,\ninclude an extra pipe symbol at that point:\nThis is the same index line as above, with only the Body Text (\"a letter dated May\n16, 2005\") omitted. There is an extra pipe at that point to indicate that there is no\nBody Text.\nSet Up Paragraph Data\nThe paragraph margins do not have to be set up each time you generate an\nindex. After setting them up the first time in the Master Format, they will remain in\nyour user settings, and will be used in future jobs.\nAs mentioned in the previous section, one of the components of an index line is\nthe Paragraph Style. The paragraph style is used to control the appearance of the\nindex. (It is common to use the Index1 paragraph style for this purpose;\nalternatively, you can create a new paragraph style .)\nThe paragraph margin settings have special meanings for indexing paragraphs:\nÂ· Indentation dictates where the Index Item begins. A setting of 0 will start the\nIndex Item at the far left. If you want the index item indented, set this to a\nnumber above 0 (such as 5).\nÂ· Text Column dictates where the Description begins. This needs to be set high\nenough to leave room for the entire Index Item. A setting of 15 is typical; if\nthe Index Item is not indented, this leaves room for up to 14 characters in the\nIndex Item, and one space before the Body Text begins. If you are not using a\nBody Text, this setting is less important.\nÂ· Left Margin dictates where the second and subsequent lines of the Body Text\nbegin. Typically, you would set this to the same number you set Text Column\nto. Again, since this setting only affects Body Text, it is less important if you\nare not using Body Text.\n362\n448\n566 Eclipse Help\nÂ· Right Margin dictates where the Body Text wraps to the next line. The number\nfor this setting needs to lower than the number of the first tab by at least 4, to\nleave room for the first page number.\nÂ· Tab Stops are chosen in Tab Stops dialog . You need to select one tab stop\nfor each column you are using for page/line/volumne numbers. If you are\nindexing only page numbers, you need only one tab stop. For a multicolumnar\nsetup (such as for page and line number, or for \"marked\" and\n\"identified\" page numbers), you will need at least two tab stops.\nWhen setting up indexing for the first time, any changes you make to paragraph\nmargin settings need to be made in both the Master Format and the Current\nDocument .\nAgain, once your paragraph margins are set up correctly in the Master Format,\nnew documents will be created with these correct settings in place. You do not need\nto set them each time, or edit them at all unless you make a change to the\nappearance of your indexes.\nGenerate The Index\nOnce the index lines are in place, an index can be generated via Generate\nIndex . You will be asked the following questions:\nÂ· Which volume numbers do you want to index?\nÂ· Do you want to create an index for just the active document, or do you want to\ncreate a master index of multiple jobs?\nYou will then be given an opportunity to preview the index, and to change the\nnumber of extra pages that are inserted (since generating an index at the beginning\nof a document changes the pagination of the remainder of the file).\nIf you previously generated and accepted an index, you will be asked if you want\nto remove the existing index. Answer Yes to remove the existing index, or No to keep\nit (the newly generated index will be added to the transcript).\nIf you edit your document after indexing, and an item in the index has moved\nto a different page, the location reference in the index is updated automatically.\nFor more details on creating an index automatically, see the Help file \"Indexing\nin More Depth \" or the Automoatic indexing.pdf found on the Advantage Software\nwebsite, at http://www.eclipsecat.com/content/utilities-and-more\n(Note: You must be signed in to your support account at eclipsecat.com to\naccess the documents there.)\nDynamic Index locations\nUnder User settings/Document/Advanced, the option for Dynamic Index\nLocations allows indexes to auto-adjust when edits are made after generating the\nfinal index.\n455\n432\n987\n570\nAutomatic Indexing 567\nNew indexes add a special tag to the location format linking to the index\nparagraph in the document, and also preserves page/line tag designations to allow\nthem to be modified. If you view the paragraph label of an index line, you will see\nitems such as {P32} and {L5} and {I281}.\nThe Page/Line numbers in these tags do NOT change. Instead, they preserve the\noriginal index positions. If you turn the \"dynamic index locations\" option OFF, the\nindex lines in the visible transcript display/printout will show the original generated\npage/line numbers. If you turn the option ON, you will see updated page/line\nnumbers on the screen.\nNote that when you make edits, the page/line numbers will NOT be updated\nuntil the program has had a chance to update all of the statistics in the document.\nThis is done in the background (you sometimes see \"updating statistics\" when closing\na document if it's still working on that.) You can force it to update by hitting\nCtrl+PgDn and moving the cursor to the end of the document.\n568 Eclipse Help\nThe {I281} tags in the location refer to the index command paragraph numbers.\nThese could theoretically fail if the index line is removed. Modifying doesn't cause a\nproblem, but it also doesn't do anything. The dynamic locations feature does not\nregenerate the index lines, it merely updates the page/line numbers. Note that if the\ndynamic index feature fails to find an index command, it will simply resort to the\noriginally generated page/line numbers.\nMaking a pdf with indexed items\nYou can create additional index categories for PDF files for multi-part indexes by\nplacing descriptive index lines within the created indexes. If you are making a pdf\nwith indexed items, they can be categorized under a header. You can also specify an\nadditional header parent with the HEADER//item text syntax, such as follows:\nix:Witnesses//Joe Smith\nand any index lines for direct/cross/redirect/etc., instead of being inside just a\nJoe Smith index heading, will be placed inside a Witnesses heading, inside a Joe\nSmith subheading.\n18.1 Insert Index Item\nInsert Index Item\nShift+Alt+X or Edit/Insert/Index item..\nRELATES TO: Indexing .\nThe Edit menu/Insert/Index item option opens the Automatic Index\nItem dialog, an alternate way to insert an index line.

(If you're not sure, use Right Align.)\n564\n447\n570 Eclipse Help\nÂ· Select the desired tab stop number in the Tab text box. Again, see the\nindexing overview page for an explanation of how tab stops work in\nindexing.\nÂ· When you are done, click Add. This will add the correct Location Format\nsyntax to the Location drop-down list.\nWhen you have entered all the data, click OK, and an index line will be\nautomatically added to the document.\nWhen you close this dialog, the index name and the location format are\nremembered so that the next time you use the dialog you don't have to type\nthose entries if re-using the same ones over and over.\n18.2 Indexing in more depth\nIndexing in more depth\nThree components are necessary to automatically create an index page in\nEclipse:\nÂ· The information in the transcript to be indexed, such as a speaker name or\nexhibit description\nÂ· The Eclipse index line\nÂ· A header file, which helps define the format of your indexes\nWhat You Need To Know\nYou will need to be familiar with the following:\nÂ· Basic editing in Eclipse\nÂ· Working with Print Commands\nÂ· Creating and inserting block files\nÂ· Creating and using scan fields, including pick lists and variable fields\nÂ· Setting margins and tabs for paragraph types\nÂ· Creating custom paragraph types\nÂ· The difference between working in the Master format and Current\ndocument, and how to switch between the two\nIt is important that you be comfortable with all the above tasks before\nproceeding. Automatic indexing can use all of these features.\n564\nAutomatic Indexing 571\nSetting Up The Index Paragraph Type\nAutomatic indexing requires at least one custom paragraph type to be set up in\nUser Settings beforehand. Later editions of Eclipse provide you a default paragraph\ntype called âIndex1â. It is intended for this purpose, however you will likely need to\nchange some of the default settings for that paragraph type. You may use the Index1\nparagraph type, or create your own.\nBefore you can start, you need to know where you want the following items to\nappear in your index:\nÂ· the Index Item\nÂ· page number\nÂ· where the Body Text starts and where you want it to wrap\nÂ· line number and volume number (if your index has them)\nDefine the locations of these items in terms of spaces from the left margin. For\nexample, you might say that the Index Item is 5 spaces in, the Body Text appears\nbetween 20 and 40, and the page number appears in column 45. With this\ninformation, we can now set up the index paragraph type.\nCreate And Name Your Custom Paragraph\n1. Go to User Settings/Paragraphs tab.\n2. Make sure you are in the Master Format. Click the Master Format option button\nif it is not already selected.\n3. Click New.\n4. A window will appear prompting you for a paragraph name. Type the name\nyou want and press Enter.\nIf you only need one format for your indexes, and thus do not need multiple\nparagraph types, give it a simple name like Index or Index1.\nThere are three common methods of naming index paragraphs:\nÂ· assigning each a number (Index1, Index2)\nÂ· putting the word Index followed by a brief description (IndexExb, IndexWit)\nÂ· putting the letter x followed by a longer description (xWitness, xDepo).\nHowever, you can name them anything you want.\nSet Tabs\n1. Go to User Settings/Paragraphs tab if you are not there already.\n2. Make sure you are in the Master Format. Click the Master Format option\nbutton if it is not already selected.\n3. Select the index paragraph from the list of paragraph types.\n572 Eclipse Help\n4. Click the Advanced button.\n5. Click the Tab Stops button.\n6. Click the Clear All button to delete the default tab stops.\n7. Assign a tab to the column you want the page number to land on. To assign a\ntab, type the number of the column in the text box at the top right, then click\nAdd. Set the tabs to where you want the LAST digit of the page number to\nappear. For example, if you deal with three-digit page numbers and you want\nit to start on column 40, set the tab to column 42.\n8. Assign additional tabs for line number and column number, if you use them. It\nis best to add the tabs from left to right so Tab #1 will be the âfirstâ tab going\nfrom left to right, Tab #2 the second tab in, etc.\nSet Margins\n1. Go to User Settings/Paragraphs tab if you are not there already.\n2. Make sure you are in the Master Format. Click the Master Format option\nbutton if it is not already selected.\n3. Set Indentation to where you want the Index Item to appear. For example if\nyou want the Index Item to be 5 spaces in, set indentation to 5.\n4. If you are using Body Text, set Text Column to where you want the Body\nText to begin. Be sure to set this number high enough to allow sufficient room\nfor the Index Item.\n5. Set Left Margin to the same number as Text Column. Left Margin dictates\nwhere the second line of Body Text will appear if it is too long for one line.\nStylistically, this will be the same as Text Column, because you donât want the\nfirst or subsequent lines to indent:\nExhibit 5 A letter from John Doe 27\nto Jane Doe dated 5/16/99\n6. Click OK to leave User Settings and save the paragraph type.\nHere is a graphical representation of the index components and the margins you\nneed to set up to determine their placement:\nAutomatic Indexing 573\nSome tips on setting up your index paragraphs:\nÂ· Make sure you are making the change in the Master Format and not the current\ndocument.\nÂ· You may have multiple index paragraph types. However, it is only necessary if\nyou require more than one format for your indexes. Usually one is enough.\nÂ· The difference between Indentation and Left Margin/ Text Column is the\namount of space allotted for the Index Item. So, as a practical matter, set Left\nMargin and Text Column to at least 10 higher than the Indentation to allow\nenough room.\nÂ· The Index Item does not wrap. As such, it is well suited for short items only. If\nyou need something longer in your index, set it up as Body Text.\nÂ· Set Right Margin to at least 3 lower than the first tab stop. This is so the Body\nText does not run over the page numbers.\nÂ· The paragraph name is case sensitive. If the paragraph is called IndexPar, then\nbe sure to put IndexPar in your index lines. INDEXPAR or Indexpar will not\nwork correctly.\nÂ· Index paragraphs containing long descriptions will be moved so that they\nappear entirely on the next page, and the continuation block file will be loaded\nbefore the entire paragraph instead of at the beginning of the next one.\nCreating Individual Index Lines\nNow that the index paragraphs are set up, we can focus on placing and filling out\nthe index lines. Each item that you want in your index needs to have its own index\nline.\nComponents Of An Index Line\nAn index line has five components which you can specify in the Automatic index\nitem dialog.\n1. Index name\n2. Index Item\n574 Eclipse Help\n3. Paragraph Type (Format)\n4. Body Text (Description)\n5. Location Format (set in Location toolbox)\nInserting An Index Line\nYou can insert an index line in any of three ways:\n1. Manually, using the Automatic index item function (Shift+Alt+X), found in the\nEdit menu/Insert submenu; or by pressing Alt+N, the letter I, and Enter. The\nindex line will appear above the paragraph in which the cursor is currently\nlocated.\n2. By creating an index line in an include file, so the index line is inserted\nwhenever exhibit parentheticals, examination markers, etc are encountered.\n3. Using Regular Expressions, which search for a pattern, and every time that\npattern is encountered, it acts as of there is an index line above it. Using\nRegular Expressions allows you to generate an automatic index without any\npreparation prior to the translation and editing of the transcript. For details on\nusing Regular Expressions to insert index lines, see page 8.\nNote: An index line is a print command. Like other print commands, index lines\ncan be visible or not. For purposes of learning about index lines, you will probably find\nit easier to have them visible at all times. To do this, press Alt+U to bring up User\nSettings; click the Display; and make sure the Print Commands check box is checked.\nInserting an index line using the wizard\nCommand Insert index item\nSpeed Key Shift+Alt+X\nMenu F10/Edit/Insert/Index\nitem\nToolbar Icon\n.\nYou can insert an index line using a wizard that provides guidance for entering\nthe required information and placing it in the correct syntax and order. The wizard\nthen inserts the information into an index print command.\nTo use the wizard to insert an index line, press Shift+Alt+X. The Automatic\nindex item window will appear.\nAutomatic Indexing 575\nEnter an Index name, EXHIBITS for example. Once you have entered an index\nname, it will be available as a choice in the drop-down list.\nIn the Item: field enter the Index item, in the example âExhibit 1.â\nIn the Description: field enter the Body Text. If you have none, leave it blank.\nNote that in the Item and Description fields you can type autoreplacements, use\nCtrl+D to display the time/date dialog, Ctrl+K to change capitalization, etc., just as\nyou can with any extended editing field.\nThe Format: is the paragraph type you are using. In the example, Index1 has\nbeen chosen from the list of paragraph types.\nIn the Location toolbox you tell Eclipse whether you want page/line/volume\nnumbers, and where you want them to appear.\nAfter specifying your settings, click OK and the Index line will appear in your\ntranscript.\n576 Eclipse Help\nYou can also insert an index line manually. To insert one, press Alt+N, and then\npress the letter I, and then press Enter. The index line will appear above the\nparagraph in which the cursor is currently located. For details on filling in the line\nmanually, see below, page 5.\nThe pipe symbol (Shift+\\) is used to separate the components of the index line.\nThe In: at the beginning appears automatically.\nIndex Name\nThe first part of the index line is called the Index Name. The Index Name tells\nEclipse which index to put this item into. You might have multiple indexes in a\ndocument, such as an index for Exhibits and an index for Witnesses.\nThere are four different methods you can use to input the Index Name:\nÂ· TYPE IT IN: Yes, you can just type it in when you insert the index lines. This is\nthe most common method.\nÂ· BLANK FIELD: You can use a blank field like the ones you use on your title and\ncertificate pages. Put the cursor in the index line at the point where the Index\nItem should appear, and then press (Ctrl+A) to insert the blank field.\nIn: | Index Item | Paragraph | Body Text|{TR:1}{P}\nYou would then use the (Ctrl+E) command to fill the field in.\nÂ· PICK LIST: You can also use a scan field that allows you to pick from a list.\nCreate it as above, except that the scan field will use a list file. Then when you\npress (Ctrl+E) to scan to the field, you get a list of index names to pick from.\nThis list contains selections for witnesses for the defendant and plaintiff, and\nexhibits for the defendant and plaintiff. Just select the one you want, as you\nwould normally do when selecting from a pick list to fill in a scan field.\nÂ· CONFLICT: Similar to dictionary conflicts, it works like this:\nIn: DEFWIT\\PLWIT\nYou do not select the conflict. Instead, the system selects it for you; it selects\nthe last index name that was used. This method is not recommended, however, since\nyou may not want the last one used.\nAutomatic Indexing 577\nIndex Item\nThis is what you want to be indexed. Commonly this is an attorneyâs name, a\nwitnessâs name, or an exhibit number.\nImportant note about the index item: it is only suited for small pieces of\ninformation. It must fit on one line and still allow plenty of room for the page number\nand other components of the index. It will not wrap to the next line. So if you want to\nindex something longer, use Body Text for this purpose instead.\nThere are also a few different ways to fill in the index item:\nÂ· TYPE IT IN: This is the most straightforward way to do it, but it is not very\nautomatic.\nÂ· BLANK FIELD: You can use a blank field as you would on your title page. Press\nCtrl+E to scan to that field and fill it in.\nÂ· BLANK FIELD WITH VARIABLE: If you assign the same variable to multiple\nblank fields, filling in one field with the variable will fill them all in. This is very\nuseful for the direct examination where you want to index by the witness\nname.\nIn the above example, both blank fields have the WITNESS variable. When you\ndo Ctrl+E to fill in the witness name on Line 1, it will automatically fill out the Index\nItem in the index line.\nÂ· USE A WILDCARD: A wildcard is a function that will pull some text, commonly\na speaker name or exhibit number, from the following line of the transcript. A\nlater section covers wildcards in detail.\nÂ· USE AUTOREPLACEMENTS: You can type autoreplacements, such as using\nCtrl+D to display the time/date dialog, Ctrl+K to change capitalization, etc.,\njust as you can with the globaling dialog and other dialog boxes that use the\nextended editing fields.\nParagraph Type\nIn Eclipse, you have to create a custom paragraph type for use with automatic\nindexing. This paragraph type is used to set margins for the various items in the\nindex, including the page and line numbers.\nIf you put + before the paragraph name it means to add a blank line before the\nitem automatically.\n578 Eclipse Help\nThis means if you have an Index line such as this:\nIn:EXHIBITS|No. 2|+Index1|A letter|{TR:1}{P}\nyou will end up with a blank, single-spaced Fixed line right before an Index1\nparagraph containing the item âNo. 2â with âA letterâ and the page number on it. And\nit adds this extra line AFTER sorting the items, so there is no further effort necessary\nto ensure the correct order or formatting.\nTo enter the paragraph type you can:\nÂ· TYPE IT IN: You can just type it in each time.\nÂ· PICK LIST: You can also use a scan field that allows you to pick from a list.\nCreate a list file with the names of your various paragraph types, and create a\nscan field in the index line to access that list. When you press (Ctrl+E) to scan\nto the field, you get a list of paragraph types, which you can quickly pick from.\nThis part of the index line does not lend itself to an ordinary blank field. It would\nwork, but really doesnât save you any time over just typing it in.\nSingle- and double-spacing\nSpacing is determined by the paragraph style. On the User\nsettings/Paragraphs/Advanced button, where you set the tab stops, there is an\noption called Default spacing. Set as desired.\nIf you want some of your indexes single-spaced and others double-spaced, you\nwill need two different paragraph styles.\nBody Text (Description)\nThe body text is a description of the Index Item. For example, if the index item\nis merely the exhibit number, you could use the Body Text to enter a detailed\ndescription of each exhibit.\nThe Body Text is optional; you can just leave it blank if you donât want to use it.\nBody Text can also be used instead of Index Item, or both may be used together.\nÂ· TYPE IT IN: This is the most straightforward way to do it, but it is not very\nautomatic.\nÂ· BLANK FIELD: You can use a blank field as you would on your title page. Press\nCtrl+E to scan to that field and fill it in.\nÂ· USE A WILDCARD: Again, a wildcard will pull some text, commonly a speaker\nname or exhibit number, from the following line of the transcript. We will learn\nmore about wildcards later on.\nLocation Format\nThis is the part of the index line where you tell Eclipse whether you want\npage/line/volume numbers, and where you want them to appear. Fill this part of the\nindex line out by typing it in. This information is a special code that indicates what\nitems to put in the index and where they appear.\nAutomatic Indexing 579\n{P} â Insert page number.\n{L} â Insert line number.\n{V} â Insert volume number.\n{TR:n} â Position the following item at right-aligned tab stop n.\n{TL:n}â Position the following item at left-aligned tab stop n.\n{TC:n}â Position the following item at centered tab stop n.\nTaken together, {TR:1}{P} would insert a page number at Tab Stop 1.\n{TR:2}{L} would insert a line number at Tab Stop 2.\n{TR:1}{V} would insert a volume number at TabStop 1.\n{TR:1}{P}{TR:2}{L} would insert a page number at Tab Stop 1 and the line\nnumber at Tab Stop 2.\nYou would almost always want TR, because you want your page numbers to\nright-align. If you right-align the page numbers, they will look like this:\nExhibit 1 3\nExhibit 2 75\nExhibit 3 193\nIf you left-align the page numbers, they will look like this, which is usually not\nthe preferred layout:\nExhibit 1 3\nExhibit 2 75\nExhibit 3 193\nPut the tab stop first, then the item to insert, for example {TR:1}{P}\nIf you want a page and line number, put them both in the last part of the index\nline, e.g. {TR:1}{P}{TR:2}{L}. Do not separate different items in this part of the\nindex line with a pipe, space, or anything else. Just put them next to each other. Also,\ndo not put any spaces anywhere in this line. If you do you may get unexpected results\nwhen you generate the index.\nYou can put roman numerals in index page, line and volume numbers by putting\nin an upper or lower-case R in the command to insert the number. For example,\n{TR:3}{Pr} tells the system to put the page number in lower-case roman numerals\nright flush on tab stop three. {TR:4}{VR} tells the indexer to put the volume number\nin upper case roman numerals right flush on tab stop four.\nRegular Expression index lines\nNormally, an index line in the transcript takes the following form:\nINDEX|Item|Format|Body|Location\n580 Eclipse Help\nCopies of index lines in this format are placed immediately above the paragraphs\nwhere the indexable content appears, so normally they will be placed in block files that\nare used for exhibit parentheticals, examination markers, etc.\nThere is a sixth and final item that can optionally be added to an index line, and\ninstead of placing many copies of this index line in the transcript, you only need one:\nINDEX|Item|Format|Body|Location|RegularExpression\nIndex lines in this format should be placed near the beginning of the transcript,\nafter where you place the sorting lines, such as EXAM|ALPHASORT\nA regular expression index line is identical in every way to a normal index line. It\nfollows this simple rule:\nAny paragraph in the document that contains text that matches the regular\nexpression search will behave AS IF it was preceded by the index line associated with\nthe regular expression.\nExample regular expression index line:\nEXBT|\\1|Index1||{TR:1}{P}|Exhibit (\\d+)\nThe regular expression is âExhibit (\\d+)â, which means to match any pattern\nconsisting of the word Exhibit, followed by a space, followed by a series of at least one\ndigits (at least one.) This would match a paragraph containing âExhibit 3â or âExhibit\n27â, for example, but not âexhibit 3â or âExhibit doesn'tâ, etc.\nFor EVERY paragraph in the document that contains that pattern, it would\nbehave as though that paragraph was preceded by an index line containing\nEXBT|\\1|Index1||{TR:1}{P}, which means that it would add an Index1\nparagraph to the EXBT index, with the page number on tab stop 1. Note that the way\nthis expression is written, it would work even in the body of a question or answer, for\nexample. If you ONLY wanted it to index the exhibit where it appeared inside a\nparenthetical, you could use something like \\(.*Exhibit (\\d+)\nSpecial note: The index item in this example is \\1, which is a backreference.\nBoth the index item and the body can contain backreferences which will fill in the\nappropriate part of the matched pattern.\nSpecial syntax: There are some rare occasions where you need to search for a\nparagraph break as part of a pattern. If you must do this, use {N} to indicate ANY\nparagraph break. Also, do NOT include any spaces before or after it, because\nparagraph indentations do not count as spaces. Paragraph labels DO count in a regular\nexpression search, so you can use them to search for and extract speaker names, etc.\nHere are a few more examples:\nEXBT|No. \\1|Index1|-- \\2|{TR:1}{P}|\\(Thereupon, Exhibit\n(\\d+), (.*), was .*\\)\nAutomatic Indexing 581\nThis sample would take any parenthetical in the following format:\n(Thereupon, Exhibit 2, A contract between Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones, was\nmarked.)\nand convert it into an index paragraph like so:\nNo. 2 -- A contract between Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones 63\nEXAM|\\2 -- \\1|Index1||{TR:1}{P}|(DIRECT|CROSS|RE-DIRECT|RECROSS)\nEXAMINATION{N}BY (.*):\nThis sample would take the following sequence:\nDIRECT EXAMINATION\nBY MR. SMITH:\nand turn it into an index paragraph like so:\nMR. SMITH -- DIRECT 12\nand would ALSO take the following sequence:\nCROSS EXAMINATION\nBY MR. JONES\nand turn it into an index paragraph like so:\nMR. JONES -- CROSS 53\nYou can use as many different regular expression lines as you wish, because each\none will be applied to ALL of the paragraphs in a document.\nThat means you can use them to generate multiple indexes easily (such as one\nchronological and one alphabetical) or to easily subdivide indexes according to context.\nFor example:\nPLEXBT|\\1|Index1||{TR:1}{P}|Plaintiff's Exhibit (\\d+)\nDFEXBT|\\1|Index1||{TR:1}{P}|Defendant's Exhibit (\\d+)\nThese two lines would ensure that plaintiff's exhibits and defendant's exhibits\nwere placed in two separate indexes, assuming that the parentheticals contained those\nstrings, such as (Thereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit 5 was marked.)\nWith regular expressions, you can make the patterns as flexible as necessary. For\nexample, the expression Plaintiff'?s'? Exhibits? ([A-Z0-9\\-]+) would find âPlaintiff's\nExhibit 23â or âPlaintiffs' Exhibit Aâ or âPlaintiff's Exhibits 24-27â\nHere is some further reference material for regular expressions:\n582 Eclipse Help\nSingle character commands\n. (period) Represents any single character. âd.gâ returns both âdigâ and\nâdogâ. If you need to search for an actual period, use \\.\n\\w Represents any word character\n\\W Represents any non-word character\n\\d Represents any digit\n\\D Represents any non-digit\n\\b Represents a word boundary. âfor\\bâ finds âforâ/ âfor thisâ/ âfor?â but not\nâforgetâ.\n[abc123] Represents one of the characters that are between the brackets.\n[a-e] Represents any of the characters that are between a and e.\n[a-eh-x] Represents any of the characters that are between a-e and h-x.\n[^a-s] Represents any character that is not between a and s.\nNumber commands\n* Finds zero or more of the item preceding the â*â. âAb*câ finds âAbcâ,\nâAbbcâ, âAbbbcâ, etc., but since the number can be zero, it will also find âAcâ.\n+ Finds one or more of the item preceding â+â. âAX.+4â finds âAXb4â, not\nâAX4â.\n? Finds zero or one of the item preceding the â?â. âTexts?â finds âTextâ and\nâTextsâ and âx(ab|c)?yâ finds âxyâ, âxabyâ, or âxcyâ.\n{2} Defines the exact number of times that the item preceding the opening\nbracket occurs. âtre{2}â finds âtreeâ.\n{1,2} Defines a range of times that the item preceding the opening bracket\ncan occur. âtre{1,2}sâ finds parts of both âtreesâ and âtrespassâ.\n{1,} Defines the minimum number of times that a character can occur.\nâtre{2,}â finds âtreeâ, âtreeeâ, and âtreeeeeâ but not âtreatedâ.\nEvery regular expression is a sequence of character commands optionally\nfollowed by number commands. If a character command appears without a number\ncommand following it, the assumption is that it should appear exactly once. So\nâExhibit [A-Z],â will find Exhibit A, but not Exhibit AA. Since the + means âone or\nmoreâ the expression âExhibit [A-Z]+,â will find Exhibit AA, Exhibit BBB, Exhibit\nWXYZ, etc.\nAutomatic Indexing 583\nSpecial commands\n( ) Grouping. This defines the characters inside the parentheses as a\nreference or a group. For example, âa(bc)?dâ finds âadâ or âabcdâ\n| Either/or. Finds the terms that occur before or after the â|â. For example, âthis|\nthatâ finds either âthisâ or âthatâ. Note that you can have a pattern that\ncontains a partial either/or option by using the parentheses. For example, âMr.|Mrs.\nSmithâ would not search for âMr. Smithâ or âMrs. Smithâ. Instead, it would search for\nâMr.â or âMrs. Smithâ. The correct pattern would be â(Mr.|Mrs.) Smithâ\n^ Only finds the search pattern if the pattern is at the beginning of a\nparagraph. For example, ^Okay would find the word âOkayâ only if it appeared at the\nbeginning of a paragraph.\n$ Only finds the search pattern if the pattern appears at the end of a\nparagraph. âObjection$â would find the word âObjectionâ only if it appeared at the\nend of a paragraph. The begin/end commands can work together. â^Okay$â would find\nany paragraph that contained nothing but the text âOkayâ\n\\ Search interprets the special character that follows the â\\â as a normal\ncharacter and not as a regular expression. âyes\\?â specifically finds âyes?â, not âyesâ or\nâyeâ (which would happen if you searched for âyes?â because the ? means âzero or\none.â)\n\\1, \\2, \\3 Represents a backreference to previously matched sequences in\nparentheses. The expression âb(o|e)\\1tâ finds âbootâ or âbeetâ\nBackreferences in regular expressions\nBackreferences allow you to take matched sequences of text and re-use them\neither in the search pattern or in the replacement. The number of the backreference\nindicates which sequence in parentheses you want to re-use.\nFor example, if you search for (Plaintiff's|Defendant's) Exhibit ([A-Z])\nIt will find either Plaintiff's or Defendant's, then Exhibit, then any single letter\nfrom A â Z. Once it finds that string, the backreference \\1 will either contain Plaintiff's\nor Defendant's, and the backreference \\2 will contain whatever Exhibit letter was\nfound.\nHeader Files\nIf you want certain text to appear at the top of your index, such as an overall\ntitle such as\nâE X H I B I T Sâ or a header for the top of each column in the index, you can\ninclude that information in a header file. A header file is simply an .ECL file containing\nthe information you want to appear at the top of an index. The header file might look\nsomething like this:\nINDEX OF EXHIBITS MARKED RECEIVED\n584 Eclipse Help\nYou would then have the Index Item or Body Text arranged to appear under\nâIndex of Exhibitsâ, and page numbers to appear under the Marked and Received\ncolumns. When you generate the index it will look something like this:\nINDEX OF EXHIBITS MARKED RECEIVED\nExhibit 1 15 24\nExhibit 2 19 30\nA header file must have the same name as the Index Name, and must be stored\nin the userâs block file directory. When you generate the index, the header file is\ninserted at the top of the index with the same name as the header file.\nIf you want the index to start on a new page, include a page break at the top of\nthe header file.\nContinuation Headers\nIf your index is several pages long, you may want an index header to appear at\nthe top of each page. To accomplish this, create a second header file as above, but\nappend a â2â to the filename. So if the Index Name is EXHIBITS, the continuation\nheader file would be called EXHIBITS2.ECL. Your second block file could contain the\nâcontinuedâ parenthetical exactly as you want it to appear.\nAutomatic Indexing 585\nIf you use a continuation header, it is recommended that you insert a page break\nat the beginning of the file. This ensures that the continuation header will always\nappear at the top of each page. Some index items are two or three lines long, so there\nis no guarantee that the continuation block will be inserted at exactly line one unless\nyou have a page break at the beginning of it.\nPutting Index Lines in Block Files\nRemember, this is automatic indexing. To be sure, you can insert an index line\nanywhere you like into an existing transcript, and type in the information. But by\nplacing them in our block files we can make the process automatic.\nCertain common occurrences require entries in your index. Some of these are\nÂ· sworn statements\nÂ· examination\nÂ· cross-examination\nÂ· re-direct examination\nÂ· re-cross examination\nÂ· the marking and identification of exhibits\nThese events each have their own block files. By adding index lines to the block\nfiles we can create all the index lines we need with little or no additional work.\nLetâs look at a typical block file:\n586 Eclipse Help\nThis is a complete block file, for a sworn statement. Whenever someone is sworn\nin, youâd read in this file, fill out the scan field with the deponentâs name, and continue\nwriting. By adding the appropriate index line to the block file, we can automatically\ninsert all the index lines we need into the transcript. This is the same block file with an\nindex line added. (You may remember this graphic from before.)\nNow, filling in the Witness name in the scan field on Line 1 will also add it to the\nindex line. Zero additional keystrokes. When you generate the index this deponentâs\nname will appear in the DepExams index.\nCreating âAutomaticâ Index Lines Using Variable Fields\nWhen adding generic index lines to your block files, the trick is to create the\nindex lines such that the content of the index lines will be generated for you.\nIf you generally enter information into your autoincludes by filling out scan fields,\nthen it makes sense to also use scan fields in your index lines. By using variable fields,\nfilling out one field (which you are already doing) will also fill out the index line.\nMaking it âAutomaticâ\nCertain common occurrences require entries in your index. Some of these are\nsworn statements; examination; cross-, re-direct and re-cross examinations; and the\nmarking and identification of exhibits. Each of these events already has its own block\nfile. By adding index lines to the block files, we can create all the individual index lines\nwe need with little or no additional work. But, the information is going to change each\ntime it is filled in. You can account for this by using wildcards in the index line.\nWildcard Indexing\nYou can use wildcard symbols in your index lines to automatically pull\ninformation from the following paragraph.\nAutomatic Indexing 587\n*The asterisk is the basic wildcard unit; it means âfind anythingâ. Use it in place\nof text that will change from item to item. For instance, if you use the string Exhibit *\nwas marked, the automatic index procedures will search for a string starting with\nExhibit, followed by anything, followed by was marked. It would be able to find, for\nexample, Exhibit 1 was marked or Exhibit 4B was marked, et cetera. You can have as\nmany asterisks in your search string as necessary to allow for variability.\nSuppose your âswornâ block file is as follows:You need the deponentâs name,\nwhich will be filled into the blank field on Line 2, added to the WITNESS index. While\nsome people will put a scan into the index line, a better approach is to use a wildcard.\nThe * character in an index line will pull everything from the following paragraph\ninto that section of the index line. If you make an index line that looks like this:\nEach time you read in this block file and fill in the field, the * will pull the name\nyou filled into the Index Item section of the index line.\nFilling in the scan field each time will also fill in the index line automatically,\nbecause the * in the index line copies in whatever you entered into the scan field. In\nthe above, âJOHN DOEâ would be the Index Item.\nOnce the index line is correctly set up in the block file, generating the index\nrequires no extra work. You have to read in the block file and fill in the field, which you\nhave to do anyway, and the index lines fills itself in automatically. All you have to do is\nset up the Index Name, Paragraph Style, and Location Format for how you want\nentries of this sort to look in your index.\nLimiting Wildcards\nSuppose that in your sworn block file, a comma appears after the personâs name:\nIf you use the * by itself, the comma will also appear in the index, as the * will\ncopy in the entire contents of the following paragraph.\nTo exclude something from being copied into your index line, put it in brackets\n[ ].\n588 Eclipse Help\nYou put the [,] after the *, because you want the wildcard to copy in everything\nbefore the comma. If the text you want excluded from the index is at the beginning,\nyou would put the bracketed material first.\nTo get something from the middle, use bracketed text at both ends. This is\ntypical, as you may need to exclude large sections of the text of the parenthetical:\nThe * will copy everything between [Whereupon ] and [ was]. The word Exhibit\nand the number would appear in the index. If you wanted just the number and not the\nword âExhibitâ, you would do:\nNote that spaces are included inside the brackets. This will exclude the spaces\nfrom the result. A search between [Whereupon] and [was] would include the spaces,\nand youâd get extra spaces in your index.\n(Indexing wildcards treat spaces and lock-spaces the same way.)\n< and > - The angle brackets (greater than and less than symbols) are used to\nsurround text that should be inserted into the index. For instance, in the previous\nexample, you might want the word Plaintiff's to appear before the word Exhibit, even\nthough it does not appear in the paragraph below the index command line. In that\ncase, the index command line would have <Plaintiff's> *[ was].\nWhere to Use Wildcards\nThe Index Item and Description sections of the index line lend themselves to\nusing wildcards. You can place them in one or the other, or both:\nAutomatic Indexing 589\nThe above index line has wildcards in both the Index Item and Description, and\nuses limiting techniques covered earlier.\nSpeaker Name Wildcard\nThe text M:* will pull the paragraph label, commonly the speaker name, from the\nnext paragraph.\nWhen examination begins, it is customary to write a by-line indicating who is\ndoing the questioning immediately after reading in the above block file. The M:* will\ncopy the speaker name from the by-line that follows into that section of the index line.\nC:* works the same as M:* does, but it inserts the label into your index in ALL\nCAPS. Example: If a speaker paragraph starting with MR. SMITH is preceded by an\nindex item that reads Examination By M:* will read âExamination By Mr. Smith:â in\nthe index.\nThe â_â character can be used to indicate a literal character in the automatic\nindex wildcard commands. Some automatic indexes required the [, ], < and >\ncharacters, which are special command characters in the indexing. Now you can put a\n_ before them if you want them to be literal.\nFor example, [Exhibit]* means look for âExhibitâ but don't insert it, but _[No.\n*_] means search for [No. *] in the text, with the asterisk representing any text.\nAdding text\nIf you want the index to contain text that does not appear in the following\nparagraph, place it in angle brackets < >:\nThe index entry would read âPlaintiffâs Exhibit â followed by the number, even\nthough the word âPlaintiffâsâ does not appear in the autoinclude. Again notice that\nthere is a space inside the angle brackets. Without it, the result would be\nâPlaintiffâsExhibit.â\nSeparator Character\nYou may want a period or some other character between the index item and the\npage number, like this:\nExhi bi t 1. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17\nExhi bi t 2. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 61\nTo do this, include {S} in the Location Format, plus whatever character you want\nto use as the separator immediately after the S.\n590 Eclipse Help\nSome common separators and their effects:\n{S.} Exhibit 1......................... 17\n{S-} Exhibit 1------------------------- 17\n{S. }Exhibit 1. . . . . . . . . . . . . 17\nNote that the separator may be more than one character.\nMultiple Instances of an Item\nIf the same index entry appears on multiple pages, you may want an index entry\nthat looks like this:\nBY MR. SMI TH . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 61, 98\nTo accomplish this, the second instance of the index line will have a comma in\nthe location format, in place of the tab stop:\nWhen Eclipse encounters an index line with no location format, where all the\nother components match a previous entry exactly, it will copy that text into the\nexisting entry.\nNote that if you plan to do this, when setting up tab stops you will need to allow\nmore space for page numbers.\nMulti-column Indexing\nYou may want a two- or four-column arrangement for an index:\nTo accomplish this, you will need to set up multiple tab stops in the paragraph\nstyle. Then, in the index line you set the tab stop to indicate which column you want\nthis particular page number to appear in:\nAutomatic Indexing 591\nThe first index line would put the page number at Tab Stop 1, under âDirectâ.\nThe second index line (which would be elsewhere in the document) would put the\npage number at Tab Stop 3, under âRe-Direct.â\nAs with multiple-instance indexing, the other components of the index line must\nmatch exactly. If not, two separate index lines will result.\nGenerating an Index\nTo generate an index, go to the position where you want it to appear, and then\npress Ctrl+I to open the Make Automatic Index Wizard.\nYou will be asked which volume numbers you want to index, and if this is an\nindex of only this job or of multiple files. Most of the time you will just be indexing one\ndocument, so you can quickly press Enter twice to bypass these dialogs. The index is\ngenerated for the whole document, unless you use volumes to specify a portion of the\ndocument. Should you want to index multiple volumes or documents, answer yes and\nfollow the prompts given. When indexing multiple files to create a multi-volume index,\nyou can move the files around in the list by using the Ctrl+Up and Ctrl+Down arrows.\nIt will search the text for a marker that indicates that an index was previously\ninserted. If it finds such a marker, it will ask you if you wish to remove the existing\nindex before generating a new one. If you answer yes, the old index will be deleted\nbefore the new one is generated, and the page numbers on the newly created index\nwill be accurate. (Note that indexes generated in older versions of Eclipse will not\nauto-delete since they were not created with the special marks.)\n592 Eclipse Help\nYou will then see a Preview of your index. If there are any problems with the\nformatting, you can click Reject or press Escape to cancel, without the index being\ngenerated.\nClicking Accept, or pressing Enter, will accept the index.\nNotice that there is an option to indicate how many pages are added to your\nindex.\nWhen you generate an index, the extra pages you are generating will change the\npagination of the document. Eclipse needs to add page numbers to account for this;\notherwise, your index will be inaccurate.\nAutomatic Indexing 593\nWhen you accept the index, a certain number of pages will appear in the Preview\ndialog. This page numbers will be incremented by this amount. Eclipse suggests a\nnumber of pages; usually the default setting will be correct. If itâs not, you can\nincrease or decrease it as needed.\nAs mentioned earlier, it is good practice to include a page break in each index\nheader file and in whatever block file follows your index. This prevents errors in the recalculation\nof page numbers.\nSorting the Exams Index by Deponent\nIf you want to make an examinations index that looks like this:\nJANE DOE\nBy Mr . Mason 90\nBy Mr . Mat l ock 104\nBy Mr . Webst er 116\nBy Mr . Smi t h 135\nJOHN Q. PUBLI C\nBy Mr . Mason 23\nBy Mr . Mat l ock 44\nBy Mr . Webst er 76\nRI CHARD ROE\nBy Mr . Mat l ock 139\nBy Mr . Webst er 166\nYou will have to set up the paragraph type and your index lines a certain way.\nYou will also need at least one additional paragraph style.\nIf the Indentation for an indexing paragraph style is set to â1, the Index Item\nwill be invisible. (Note: the interface will not let you type a minus sign. Use the spin\ncontrol or arrow keys to set this to â1.)\nThis allows you to use the Index Item as sort criteria. To get the index to sort in\nthis fashion, you would put the deponentâs name as the Index Item for all index lines\nthat go into this index. You would then put the attorneyâs name in the Description. The\nindex line for Jane Doe being examined by Mr. Mason would look like this:\nThe Index Item is âDoe â (note trailing space) and the Description is BY MR.\nMASON.\nYou would set the Indentation to â1, and set the Left Margin, Right Margin, Text\nColumn, and tab stops to dictate where you want the attorneyâs name and the page\nnumber to appear, as normal.\nIn the above graphic, Left Margin and Text Column for IndexPar would be 5; tab\nstop 1 would be 30; and Right Margin would be about 26.\nTo insert the deponentâs name in the index, you would make a line like this:\n594 Eclipse Help\nYou have to use a different paragraph style because the deponentâs name JANE\nDOE is not indented, where as BY MR. MASON is. The Left Margin/Body Text would be\n0; all other settings would be the same as in IndexPar (though Right Margin and tab\nstops are not crucial, as there is no page number being inserted).\nThe Location Format has been omitted, because we do not wish to insert a page,\nline or volume number.\nNote that the Index Item for the name does not have a trailing space, whereas it\ndoes for the attorneys that interview that name. This is so the deponentâs name will\nalways âsortâ first in the list.\nThis approach can be used in conjunction with wildcard indexing, as well as any\nother technique covered in this document. A sworn statement that accomplishes this\nsetup might look like this:\nThere is a field in the Index Item section of the index line. You will probably need\nto manually enter the sort criteria, as it is difficult to design a wildcard setup that will\nget it automatically.\n(A setting of [ ]*[,] in the Index Item would get the text between a space and\nthe comma, isolating the last name in most cases. But you could get a person with a\ntwo-word name, or multiple deponents with the same last name, making it impractical\nto create a wildcard entry that merely isolates the last name.)\nAnd the line in the direct/cross/redirect/recross block file would look like this:\nThe M:* in the Description will copy in the speaker name that follows. There is a\nfield in the Index Item, as above, for you to enter the sort criterion. The trailing space\nis included in the Index Item as well.\n18.3 Frequently Asked Questions\nFrequently Asked Questions\nAutomatic Indexing 595\nDo I have to use all five components of the index line?\nNot every index line requires all five components. Some can be omitted, however\nthere are some rules to follow when doing so. If you are creating your index line and\ncome to the point where you want to omit something, simply move on to the next\npipe. Donât even put a space. Just put nothing.\nFor example, this is an index line that does not include Body Text:\nYou must include all the pipes, unless you are omitting items from the end. If\nyou are dropping items from the end, such as when you create a short index line, the\npipes at the end may be dropped. In other words, internal pipes must be included;\ntrailing pipes can be dropped. If youâre not sure, just include all four pipes (it wonât\nhurt anything).\nNow, letâs look at the effects of omitting each of the components:\nINDEX NAME: Index Name is required. It cannot be omitted.\nINDEX ITEM: Index Item can be left blank. However, in practice you will want\nto use either Index Name or Body Text. If you omit both, there will be nothing in your\nindex describing what the thing is. For example, the following is a perfectly legitimate\nindex line:\nIn: DEFEX||IndexPar||{TR:1}{P}\nThis will give you a line in the DEFEX index that contains only a page number.\nThe produces a Table of Contents with page numbers and no corresponding items. This\ncan be useful if you have unanswered, refused, and certified question indexes which\nonly have the page number and line numbers.\nPARAGRAPH TYPE: You can omit this, but probably shouldnât. If Paragraph\nType is omitted, it will set up your index based on your Fixed paragraph settings. You\nare better off creating a custom paragraph for indexes and including it in this part of\nthe index line.\nBODY TEXT: If the Index Item is adequate to identify the item in the index, you\ncan drop Body Text. This is the most commonly omitted item of the five.\nLOCATION FORMAT: This can be omitted if you want an item in your index with\nno page number, line number, or volume number.\nHow do I determine the placement and order of my indexes?\nIndexes are always generated at the cursor position.\nTo indicate the order in which you want your indexes to appear when generated,\nplace a short index line in the title page.\nA short index line consists of only the Index Name:\n596 Eclipse Help\nPlace the short index lines in the title page in the order you want them to\nappear:\nIn the above graphic the index would appear after the appearance page, and\nwould be preceded by a page break, as long as that is where your cursor was when\nyou generated the index. The WITNESS index would be first, followed by PEXHIBIT\nand DEXHIBIT (Plaintiffâs and Defendantâs Exhibits) in that order.\nThe WITNESS.ECL, PEXHIBIT.ECL and DEXHIBIT.ECL (if you created them) will\nalso be inserted at the cursor location when the index is generated.\nIf you do not include short index lines, the indexes will be generated at the\ncursor and will appear in whatever order they did in the document.\nHow do I change the way my index sorts?\nBy adding |ALPHASORT or |NUMSORT to the short index line. Like this:\nThis will sort the Defendantâs Witnesses index alphabetically. NUMSORT sorts\nnumerically.\nAutomatic Indexing 597\nHow do I insert a blank line into the index?\nTo have the items in your index separated by a blank line, add a + to the\nbeginning of the\nParagraph Style:\nIN: DEFEX|Exhibit 1|+IndexPar|A photograph|{TR:1}{P}\nEclipse adds this extra line AFTER sorting the items, so there is no further effort\nnecessary to ensure the correct order or formatting.\nHow do I get two different page numbers to appear in one index\nline?\nHave two index lines in the transcript. The Index Items must match exactly; the\nplacement of the page number must not be on the same tab stop.\nFor example, you might have the following lines at two different spots in the\ntranscript:\nIn: EXB|EXHIBIT 1|INDEXPAR||{TR:1}{P}\nIn: EXB|EXHIBIT 1|INDEXPAR||{TR:2}{P}\nThis would give you:\nExhibit 1 13 20\nOf course, you would have to set up Tab 1 and Tab 2 in the INDEXPAR paragraph\ntype to dictate where the page numbers appear. You will probably also want a header\nfile to clarify which column is which. Like this:\nEXHIBITS INDEX\nMARKED RECEIVED\nExhibit 1 13 20\nThe text âExhibits Indexâ as well as the column headings âMarkedâ and\nâReceivedâ is in the header file, set up as per the above section on header files. This\napproach is useful if you want one index to indicate page numbers for Exhibit\nMarked/Exhibit Received, or Direct/Cross/Redirect/Recross Examinations.\nIf the tab stops match, it will make two lines in the index.\nThe following will overlap:\nIN: DEFEX|No.2|IPG4||{TR:1}{P}\nIN: DEFEX |No.2|IPG4||{TR:2}{P}\nIN: DEFEX |No.2|IPG4||{TR:1}{P}\nIN: DEFEX |No.2|IPG4||,{P}\n598 Eclipse Help\nThe following will not overlap:\nIN: DEFEX |No.2|IPG4||{TR:1}{P}\nIN: DEFEX |No.2|IPG4||{TR:1}{P}\nAlso, Automatic indexing will overlap an empty item on top of the last item in the\nindex if and only if there is a location format with no item text. So, if you have:\nIX:EXAM|John Smith|Index1||{TR:1}{P} followed by\nIX:EXAM||Index1||{TR:2}{P}\nit will overlap the items just as if the second item had said âJohn Smith.â\nHow come my paragraph type, or {TR:1}{P} showed up in the text\nof my index?\nYour individual index line is not set up correctly. You are likely missing a pipe.\nReview the index line in question.\nHow do I create a master index?\nYou can create an empty file, select the automatic index procedure, tell it to\nindex multiple documents and then select the documents for which you want to create\nan index. If you want the index to appear in a separate file, set the number of pages in\nthe Preview window to zero.\nWhen I change the paragraph margins, why does it does not take\neffect in the preview?\nRemember to make changes in both the Master Format and the Current\nDocument. Easiest way; make changes in the Current and copy to Master.\nWhy am I getting strange characters in the index when I generate?\nIf itâs {TR:1}{P} or other indexing syntax, your index line is probably missing a\npipe. Review the index line in question. Alternatively, if you are using scan fields in the\nindex line (even though we recommend using wildcards), the fields need to be filled in\nbefore the index is generated. Unfilled fields may appear as odd characters.\nCan I use scan fields in my index lines instead of wildcards?\nYes, but wildcards are more powerful and less work to fill in once they are set up\ncorrectly.\nWhy does my paragraph style not seem to be taking effect?\nLook at the paragraph bar to the left. Is it an F? If so, Eclipse is using a Fixed\nparagraph style instead of your indexing paragraph style. This usually means that\nEclipse is not recognizing the Paragraph Type section of the index line. Check your\nspelling/capitalization/use of pipe symbols in the index line. Also, confirm that the\nparagraph style exists in both the Master and the Current. Copy it over if it does not.\nAutomatic Indexing 599\nWhy is my header file not being used?\nThe header file must be stored in the Blocks folder, as selected in User\nSettings/Advanced.\nSpecial warning: if you generate an index and there is no header file, Eclipse will\ncreate a blank one. Thus you may look in your Blocks folder and see a file called\nEXHIBIT.ECL, even though this is the blank file Eclipse created and your EXHIBIT.ECL\nis in the wrong folder. So donât just check that the file name exists, open it and\nconfirm that the text is there.\nWhy is text running over the page number?\nYou need to move the tab stop for the page number further to the right, or set\nthe Right Margin lower so the text wraps sooner. This is all done on the Paragraphs\ntab.\nHow do I insert an index line at the bottom of a file (such as the\nâDirect Examinationâ blurb to use M:*)?\nWhen you insert a print command, it will appear above the current paragraph. To\nget it at the end of a file, add some extra lines, insert the index line, and then yank\nthe lines with Ctrl+Y.\nI generated and accepted an index, and itâs not there.\nThe screen may not refresh right away. Ctrl+Page Down/Ctrl+Page Up should\nrefresh it.\nCan I edit an index after generating it?\nYes, if you really know how to work with paragraph labels, and you are correcting\na very small problem. Youâre best off deleting and regenerating.\n600 Eclipse Help\n19 Production and Delivery of your Transcript\nProduction and Delivery of your Transcript\nIn addition to printing , you have several options for delivering your\ntranscript to your customers.

You may also have an option entitled\n\"Number of Pages per sheet.\" If you do, you can use this setting to print\ncompressed transcripts with a number of pages other than four; however,\nquality may not be as good as you get in Eclipse's Multi-page feature. To\nprint a four-page compressed transcript, you should always use the Print\ndialog .\nThe Size list box allows you to select the size of paper you are printing\non.

A multi-page transcript is also known as a compressed transcript, or a\nfour-in-one transcript.\nTo print a multi-page transcript, simply print the transcript as usual, , and\nselect either Multi-page or Multi-page with Index from the drop-down list on the\nPrint dialog .\nThe Options button on the Print dialog will open the Multi-page Printout\nOptions dialog , where you can control the appearance of your multi-page\ntranscripts.\nMulti-page pre-sets\nMulti-page can be daunting to set up because there are so many options. Market\nresearch shows that nearly everyone, no matter what multi-page software they use,\nconforms to a nearly universal standard: Four pages per sheet, a four-part box drawn\naround all of the pages, a binding margin on the left, custom headers on the top and\nbottom, and just the 25 numbered lines and page numbers within the boxes.\nIn order to make it easier to set up, The multi-page dialog offers five styles,\nlabeled \"Style 1, Style 2 ...\" in the drop-list at the top of the multi-page dialog. Select\na style and hit the \"View sample\" button to see a sample of a transcript creating using\nthe selected style. Examples can be seen here.\nIf you wish to use that style, hit the \"Select\" button and all of the multi-page\nsettings will be changed so that your multi-page printout will look like the sample.\nIf you wish to customize from there, it will be much easier to start with a predefined\nstyle and tweak a few items than to start from scratch and try to set\neverything manually.\nThe five styles are, in summary:\n600 601\n610\n600\n601\n601\n610\n612\n606 Eclipse Help\nâ¢ Style 1: Boxed pages, Two-line header and footer, Arial and Courier fonts, Bold\nanswers\nâ¢ Style 2: Boxed pages, one-line header and footer, Times New Roman and\nLucida Console fonts\nâ¢ Style 3: Individual page boxes, individual headers/footers on each page from\nthe original transcript, Arial fonts\nâ¢ Style 4: Timecodes left\nâ¢ Style 5: Timecodes right\nCustomization hint 1: Fonts and font sizes are the easiest things to change. Pick\na style based on the overall shape of the layout and change the fonts from there.\nChanging the number of header lines, or the layout of the boxes, is trickier since you\nthen may have to adjust other items to fit around them, so don't pick a style based on\nthe fonts and then try to add more header lines, for example.\nCustomization hint 2: The headers are pre-built with job variables that may not\nmatch what you use. Replace them with your own, or simply type text in their place,\nbeing careful not to delete or add pipe | characters.\nWord Index\nA word index, also known as a word list or concordance, is a list of words that\nappears in a transcript, indexed to the volume, page and line number they appear on.\nTo print a word index, select Multi-Page With Index, Full Size with Index, or\nIndex Only from the drop-down list on the Print dialog , and then click OK to\nprint.\nMulti-page document overrides\nIn order to get the multi-page document to conform precisely to expectations, it\nis almost always necessary to override some of the document's full-sized settings,\nsuch as margins, spacing, etc.\nAs of Version 7, Eclipse has every document setting that you are likely to want\nto override built into the multi-page option dialog so that they can be overridden\neasily. If you simply want the lines in the multi-page to be spaced out a bit more, just\ngo to the multi-page dialog and select \"line spacing\" and make it slightly larger than\nthe line spacing in the document.\nThe .set file mechanism is there if you need to override something that is not on\nthe list.\nMost of the settings are numerical and are presented as a droplist/number box\nmechanism. The index columns and index threshold are consolidated into this list.\nHere is a list of the settings in the multi-page dialog and what they do. Note\nthat any setting that is specifically an override of a document setting should be set to\n-1 if you want to keep using the original document setting for that metric.\n617\n601\nProduction and Delivery of your Transcript 607\nâ¢ Page Format -- overrides the document's page format since many multi-page\nformats prefer \"page X\" on the multi-page document but just \"X\" on the fullsized\nversion.\nâ¢ Maximum text width -- Set this to prevent fonts from extending outside the\nbox. The text is not allowed to exceed this distance. If you have a large\nnumber of capital letters on a line, it will not poke the line out the right side of\nthe box. Instead, it will shrink the font just for that one line so that it fits\nwithin this measurement.\nâ¢ Row 1 offset, Row 2 offset, Column 1 offset, Column 2 offset -- the\ndistance that the rows or columns of miniaturized pages move up, down, left or\nright (can be positive or negative.) Use to fit the page more precisely inside\nwhatever borders you have selected. These numbers are set for you when you\nuse a pre-defined format, but you can adjust these values without affecting\nanything else.\nâ¢ Top margin -- overrides the top margin of the document. Note that this will\nNOT affect the top margin of the multi-page document. It affects the top\nmargin of the individual miniaturized pages. Extra space at the top of a multipage\noutput is generally not desirable, but can be accomplished by adding\nadditional empty header lines (examples provided in the preset samples.)\nâ¢ Left margin -- overrides the left margin of the document. In multi-page, this\nwill be the binding margin on the left side before the left edge of the box. If\nyou select Left margin/Full-sized, duplexed, then the full-sized document as\nwell as the multi-page document will print with a binding margin appearing\nalternately on the left and right sides of the paper.\nâ¢ Right margin -- Documents don't use a right margin since each paragraph\nuses its own margins. Set this when you need to dictate how much space there\nis between the right side of the paper and the automatically drawn multi-page\nboxes.\nâ¢ Footer offset -- The location of the footer is determined by the page size and\nnumber of footer lines. The automatic position may not be precisely what\nyou're looking for, so this number (which defaults to zero) gives you a way to\ntell the software to put the footer higher or lower on the page. Keep in mind\nthat this will stretch the automatic boxes, so adjust this value after deciding\nhow many footer lines you want, and before you adjust the row 1 and 2 offsets.\nâ¢ Header margin, footer margin -- overrides the header/footer margins of the\ndocument. Does not affect the multi-page headers and footers, only the\nreduced-size individual page versions, as in Style 3.\nâ¢ Line height -- overrides the line height of the document. Use this to stretch\nout the lines farther apart or put them close together.\nâ¢ Character spacing -- overrides the character spacing of the document. Note\nthat this only applies to fixed-space fonts, but this can be particularly useful if\nyou want to maximize the font size for the fixed-space portions of the\ntranscript, since the spacing can be adjusted independently from the font\nheight.\n608 Eclipse Help\nâ¢ Line number margin -- overrides the line number margin of the document.\nâ¢ Page number row, page number column -- overrides the page number\nposition of the document. Use in conjunction with the page format field to\ncustomize what multi-page page numbers look like. You can add a line number\nformatting option in the page number format separated by a pipe sign. For\nexample {P####}|{L<0###} shows up to a four-digit page number and will\npad all line numbers to three digits with zeros, such as 005, 012, etc.\nâ¢ Timecode margin -- overrides the timecode margin of the document. None of\nthe built-in samples have timecodes appearing on the multi-page output.\nTimecodes are difficult to put on a multi-page output and still be reasonably\nreadable, so they should usually be limited to the full-sized output. If you need\nto include timecodes, the fonts will have to be reduced and margins adjusted.\nâ¢ Paragraph number margin -- overrides the paragraph number margin of the\ndocument.\nâ¢ Text box left, top, width, height -- Using the original text box from the fullsized\ndocument only works if you don't change any of the margins. Once you\nstart changing the margins, line height, etc., it no longer fits. These\nadjustments allow you to specify an exact location for the multi-page version of\nthe text box that is used to outline each separate miniaturized page, as in\nStyle 3.\nMulti-page header/footer with job variables\nYou can put job variables from the form field system into the header and footer\nby using {VARNAME} anywhere in the header/footer, so you won't have to type the\nwitness name, the case number, the current date, etc., in three or four different\nplaces.\nSo, for example, if you have a field with a variable called WITNAME where you\ntype the witness, and another where you fill in the DATE (or maybe MONTH, DAY and\nYEAR) you can just put {WITNAME} and {DATE} (or {MONTH}, {DAY} {YEAR}) in\nthe multi-page header/footer box.\nThe default Style 1-3 presets hint at this by putting {WITNESSNAME} and\n{DATE}, etc., in the header/footer that are created when you select a preset.\nKeep in mind that the multi-page header/footer settings are permanent, so if\nyou want them to be different for each printout, you have to manually go in and\nchange them each time.\nDetails on the syntax for headers and footers can be found here.\nMulti-page full-sized Cover Page\nThis feature prints a decorative cover page as the first sheet in a multi-page\nprintout. (Note that is does not print the regular title page in full size.)\n615\nProduction and Delivery of your Transcript 609\nYou can access this from the User settings/Programming tab, under \"Cover\npage.\" If you leave it blank, no cover page will be printed. The cover page is always\nprinted using an enlarged version of the default multi-page font, for consistency's\nsake. It also always prints each line centered, and centers the entire body of the text\nvertically.\nSo, for example, you could type the following as your cover page:\nIn the matter of\n__________________________\nJoe Consumer, Plaintiff\nv.\nVery Large Corporation, Defendant\nCase no. 123456\n__________________________\nDeposition of\nMillicent Bystander\n__________________________\nJanuary 16, 2015\nat the offices of\nSuperlative Court Reporting\n800-555-1234\n...and you would get a decorative cover page before your multi-page output.\nYou can also use Job variables, and type this into the cover page:\nIn the matter of\n__________________________\n{PLAINTIFF1}, Plaintiff\nv.\n{DEFENDANT1}, Defendant\nCase no. {CASENUM}\n610 Eclipse Help\n__________________________\nDeposition of\n{WITNESSNAME}\n__________________________\n{DATE}\nat the offices of\nSuperlative Court Reporting\n800-555-1234\nKeep in mind that if there is a large amount of variation between the cover\npages for the types of transcripts that you do, a template like this might not be\nflexible enough.\nIn this case, you can add additional variables to replace things like the words\n\"Plaintiff\" and \"Defendant\" just as you would on a title page.\nIf your cover pages are so variable that they cannot be templatized, you can still\nmake them document specific by simply putting a series of lines in the Cover Page\nthat read {COVER1}, {COVER2}, {COVER3}, etc., for as many lines as you need,\nthen add a series of comment lines in your document above your title page containing\nthose fields. Whatever you fill into those fields would appear on the cover page.\nVISUALIZERS:\nI1 - Printing\nI3 - Multi-page\nI3 - Multi-page Settings\nI3a - Multi-page Index\nI1a - Delivery\n19.1.4 Multi-page Printout Options\nMulti-page Printout Options\nProduction and Delivery of your Transcript 611\nRELATES TO: Print , Print dialog,\nDelivery , Working With Multi-page\nPrinting and Word Index .\nIf you select one of the multi-page printing options on the Print dialog, and hit\nthe Options button, the Multi-page printout options dialog opens.\nPresets\nA multi-page transcript is a printed transcript that contains four pages on one\npiece of paper. You can also print two pages on each piece of parer by selecting \"2-\npage\" from the Page order drop-down list.

For example, Style 1 looks like this:\nIf you wish to use that style, hit the \"Select\" button and all of the multi-page settings\nwill be changed so that your multi-page printout will look like the sample. You can\ncustomize from there, starting with a pre-defined style and changing only the items\nthat need to be different.\nFont Management\nThe drop-down list at the top left allows you to assign different fonts to different\ncomponents of the multi-page transcript. The item you select will appear in the font\nyou select via the Font button to the right.\nProduction and Delivery of your Transcript 613\nHere are your choices:\nÂ· Default font affects any text that does not belong to any of the below\ncategories.\nÂ· Header font and Footer font affect the font of full-sized headers and footers\n(not headers/footers that appear inside the reduced pages).\nÂ· Single-spaced font affects the font of text in any paragraph that is set to\nsingle-spaced . Selecting a smaller font for single-spaced lines can keep lines\nfrom overlapping.\nÂ· Fixed font affects any paragraph type set to behave as fixed, unless it is also\nsingle-spaced.\nÂ· Question label font, Answer label font and Speaker label font affect the\nlabels for questions, answers, and speakers (the Q symbol, A symbol, and\nspeaker IDs).\n451\n451\n614 Eclipse Help\nÂ· Question font, Answer font, and speaker font affect the text of Question,\nAnswer, and Speaker paragraphs.\nÂ· Parenthetical font affects any paragraph set to behave as parenthetical.\nÂ· Default label font affects any paragraph labels that do not fit any other\ncategory.\nÂ· Index font affects the font used on the concordance index. If your index looks\ntoo crowded, try setting the font to a smaller size.\nThe Font button opens the font dialog , where you can choose a font style,\nattributes, and size. Any font choices you make here will be used in multi-page\nprinting only, and will apply only to the font category you have selected from the list.\nThe Width spin control allows you to change the width of the lettering. A setting\nof 0 will use the default width; anything else will make the letters wider or narrower.\nThe area below will preview the text. Like the Font button, the Width setting will\naffect only the font category you have chosen in the list at the top left.\nThe Use Default button will clear any font customization you have done for the\ncurrent font category.\nThe preview area below the Font button will show you what your font selections\nwill look like in the document. If this area is blank, no customization has been done.\nControlling Appearance\nThe Left Margin drop-down list offers you the following choices for the behavior\nof your left margin:\nÂ· Full-Sized will print a large left margin, big enough to allow space for hole\npunching.\nÂ· Full-Sized, Duplexed will print with a binding margin appearing alternately on the\nleft and right sides of the paper, on both sides of the paper, if you are using a\nduplex printer.\nÂ· Compressed will produce a smaller left margin.\nThe Page Order drop-down list gives you the following options for page\nordering:\nÂ· Left-to-right will print page 1 at top left, 2 at top right, 3 at bottom left, and 4 at\nbottom right.\nÂ· Top-to-bottom will print page 1 at top left, 2 at bottom left, 3 at top right, and 4\nat bottom right.\nÂ· 2-page will print two pages instead of four. To use this option, you must also select\nLandscape printing in the Print Setup dialog.\nThe Borders drop-down list gives you the following options for borders:\nÂ· Use original will use the box settings you have specified in Text Box Setup ,\nwhich can be accessed from the Document tab of User Settings .\nÂ· None will display no borders.\n451\n980\n603\n477\n434\nProduction and Delivery of your Transcript 615\nÂ· Cross will draw a cross in the middle of the four pages.\nÂ· Boxed draws a box around the entire page, divided into equal segments (so each\nreduced page will appear in its own box).\nFormat\nThe format option controls the index location format. This is similar to the page\nformat feature but simpler. For details, see Word Index help page .\nHeaders and Footers\nIf Omit Headers/Footers on Reduced Pages is checked, headers and footers\nwill appear once, in large print, at the top or bottom of the page. If this item is\nunchecked, headers and footers will appear inside each individual page.\nThe large text box at bottom left allows you to insert custom headers and footers.\nType the desired header(s) and/or footer(s) into this box. The syntax is as follows:\nH:Left-Aligned Header|Centered Header|Right-Aligned Header\nF:Left-Aligned Footer|Centered Footer|Right-Aligned Footer\nThe H: or F: at the beginning of the line tells Eclipse whether this line of text is a\nheader or a footer.\nThe Left|Center|Right syntax controls the placement of the header or footer. You\nmay use these individually, or in combination. If you do not wish to use all three\nareas, place no text adjacent to the pipe symbol. Examples:\nÂ· H:Header Text|| will place a left-aligned header.\nÂ· H:|Header Text| will place a centered header.\nÂ· H:||Header Text| will place a right-aligned header.\nÂ· H:Header 1||Header 2 will align Header 1 on the left and Header 2 on the right.\nÂ· H:Header 1|Header 2| will align Header 1 on the left and Header 2 in the center.\nÂ· |H:Header 1|Header 2 will align Header 1 in the center and Header 2 on the right.\nÂ· |H:Header 1|Header 2|Header 3 will left-align Header 1, center-align Header 2, and rightalign\nHeader 3.\nIf you want a multi-line header or footer, insert two lines:\nF:Footer Line 1\nF:Footer Line 2\nIf you want to insert a header/footer to be used in the word index only, but not\nthe compressed transcript, use HI: or FI: instead of H: and F:. (You may use both F:\nand FI:, if you want the multi-page transcript and the word index to have different\nfooters.)\nHI:Word Index Header\nFI:Word Index Footer\n617\n616 Eclipse Help\nIf you want the original header or footer to appear in the multi-page header or\nfooter, use the code %T1 for the header and %F1 for the footer. If the header or\nfooter is more than one line, use %T2 and %F2 for the second line, %T3 and %F3 for\nthe third line, etc.:\nH:%T1\nYou can also insert dates and times into the header using Time/Date Syntax\n:\nF:Production date: %m/%d/%y\nNote that special codes can be intermingled with regular text. In the above\nexample, the code %m will insert the month, %d the date, and %y the year, each in a\ntwo-digit format. The slashes in between them will produce a U.S.-formatted date:\n04/29/06. (If you want DD/MM/YY format, you would use the code %d/%m/%y.)\nFinally, the following codes can be used to insert other information:\nÂ· %G will insert the starting page number.\nÂ· %E will insert the ending page number.\nÂ· %N will insert the sheet number.\nÂ· %F represents the first word on the current index page\nÂ· %L represents the last word on the current index page\nNote the %F, %L syntax in index header/footer for first word/last word. This\nallows the creation of dictionary/encyclopedia-style word references for index\npages.For example, if you had \"HI:Page %G|John Smith|%F - %L\" as your header\nindex, a sample page might read:\nPage 3 John Smith garage - illustration\nThat would mean that \"garage\" is the first word on that index page and\n\"illustration\" is the last word on that page.\nA \"sheet\" is one piece of paper. For example, if you are printing four pages to one\nsheet, sheet #1 would consist of pages 1 through 4, sheet #2 would be 5 through 8,\netc.\nOther Items\nAdditional options can be selected from the Options drop-down menu:\n374\nProduction and Delivery of your Transcript 617\nIndex Threshold and Index columns apply to the Word index, and are detailed\nhere.\nYou can also control the appearance of a multi-page document by creating and\nassigning a SET file .

Click the Font button to choose a smaller font.\n620 Eclipse Help\nFormat\nThe Format option controls the index location format. This is similar to the page\nformat feature but simpler.\nHere is the syntax for the default setting:\n{#V:}#P/#L\n#V represents the volume number, and if it is a single-volume index, the entire\nsequence in braces will be omitted (omitting the colon in the process.)\n#P is the page number and #L is the line nuber.\nSo the default would show 3:15/2 for volume three, page 15, line 2, or 15/2 for\npage 15, line 2 on a single-volume index. {<#V>}#P.#L would show <3>15.2 or\n15.2 for the same location.\nHeader and Footer options\nYou can use information from your full-size transcript. Here is an example using\nFill-in-the-blanks variables for the Header:\nThis example also includes syntax for including the first and last words on each\npage in the Footer.\nThe pipes control the location: (Left | Centered | Right).\nDetails on the syntax for headers and footers can be found here.\nOmit from Index\n615\nProduction and Delivery of your Transcript 621\nThere are two ways to eliminate common or unimportant words from the word\nindex. First, the Index Threshold item on the Multi-page Printout Options\ndialog allows you to automatically remove words from the word index, based on\nfrequency. Also, any word you add to the Common Words list on the\nProgramming tab will never appear in a word index.\nIndex Threshold controls the appearance of common words in the concordance.\nIf set to 1, a word that appears more than once every 1 page will not appear. If set to\n2, a word that appears once every 2 pages will not appear in the word index; a higher\nnumber means that more words will be eliminated from the word index. You can also\neliminate words from the word index by adding them to the Common Words list\non the Programming tab .\nThe Index columns setting allows you to print in columns. Adjusting the\nnumber of columns doesn't change anything else, so if you select a 4- or 5-column\nindex and it looks too cramped, you can decrease the index font size.\nIn addition, locked phrases containing common words at the beginning or end of\na line (such as the~building or a~dog) will not appear. Noise words (User\nsettings/Translate/Non-capping words) are still permitted in the middle of phrases,\nbut not at the beginning or end.\nYou can omit specific pages and paragraphs from the multi-page and full-sized\nindex output. In the multi-page settings dialog, there is a Pages: box where you can\nenter a page or range of pages to omit from the output. Clicking the Paragraphs\nbutton opens a dialog where you can select which paragraph types should not appear\nin the index.\n610\n838\n826\n838\n826\n622 Eclipse Help\nVISUALIZERS:\nI1 - Printing\nI3 - Multi-page\nI3 - Multi-page Settings\nI3a - Multi-page Index\nI1a - Delivery\n19.2 ASCII\nASCII\nShift+Alt+O\nProduction/Output to Ascii..\nProduction and Delivery of your Transcript 623\nAn ASCII (pronounced ASK-key) file is a universally recognizable format for text\nfiles.

If you have no document open, you will be required to select at\nleast one.\nThe Delivery dialog has a list of jobs to deliver (you can hit \"Add\njobs..\" to add more) and a list of delivery tasks below it. Note that if you\nwish, you can select page ranges and volumes for each separate job that\nyou're delivering by changing the Pages and Volumes text boxes.\nWhen you first use the feature, a series of default delivery tasks will be\ncreated for you: Printing a full-sized document, printing a multi-page\ndocument, creating a full-sized PDF, creating a multi-page PDF, creating a\npage-image ASCII, Bundling the created files together, and e-mailing the\nbundle to clients.\nBy default, all of these tasks will be selected, and hitting the \"Deliver\"\nbutton will perform all of those tasks on each of the selected jobs.\nIf there are certain tasks that you want to skip, you can simply uncheck\nthe boxes for the tasks you don't want to do this time before hitting the\n\"Deliver\" button.\nProduction and Delivery of your Transcript 627\nCustomizing your Delivery tasks\nPress the Edit tasks button (or Alt+E). This will make the task list\neditable. The Edit tasks button will disappear and be replaced by a Save\nchanges permanently checkbox. If you do not check this box, then any\nchanges you make will be temporary changes that will only affect this one\ndelivery. If you check the box, they'll be saved permanently in your user\nsettings.\nThere are several ways to edit the task list:\nClick the \"X\" button (or Alt+X) to delete the task from the list.\nClick the Settings gear button to customize a task.\nClick the Add task item (or Alt+A) to add a new task to the list.\nWhen adding a task, you will be asked to select a task type from among\nthe following: Print, ASCII, PDF, Bundle, e-mail, Copy and Move. Each\none has several additional options.\nIf you select Print you will be asked if you want a full-sized printout,\nMulti-page, index, etc.\nIf you select PDF you get the same options as printing.\nIf you select ASCII you will be asked what type: Page image,\nsummation, etc.\nIf you select Bundle you have to option to choose Multi-type bundle,\nMulti-volume bundle or Custom bundle.\n632\n622\n628 Eclipse Help\nTo be clear: The correct way to do multi-volume ASCII and PDF\ndocuments is normally to create a single document and use the block/read\nfunction to read the other documents into it, using the \"new volume\"\ncommands to create volume breaks for the features that can display volume\nnumbers. This method is the only way to take advantage of many features,\nsuch as creating a master multi-page index.\nHowever, there are times when what you really need is simply a way to\nbundle a series of files together in a convenient way without necessarily\ncombining them into a single document. The settings in the \"bundle\" feature\nallows you to specify whether you are making a multi-format bundler, or a\nmulti-volume bundle.\nA multi-format bundle is a bundle containing all of the different formats\nthat you have requested for a single document, such as a full-sized PDF, a\nmulti-page PDF and an ASCII file. A multi-volume bundle, on the other hand,\nwill combine all of the files you have created for all of the documents in the\njob list into a single PDF file, so if you have selected five separate jobs, you\nwill get one PDF file instead of five.\nNote that this allows you to create selective bundles, such as just ASCII\nfiles. If you selected 10 jobs, then selected bundle/multi-volume, then\nselected ONLY the ASCII checkbox, you would get a PDF file containing\nnothing but 10 ASCII files in it.\nIf you select Convert, before it adds it to the list, it opens a dialog\nwhere you choose a format, and the conversion will be part of the Delivery\nprocess.\nProduction and Delivery of your Transcript 629\nUsing the Bundle option.\nIf you add a bundle task to your task list, it changes the way that the\nsystem handles all of the files you're creating. You might be creating an\nASCII and a full-sized PDF and a multi-page PDF, and you'll get three\nseparate files. If you have \"e-mail\" as one of your options, depending on the\ncheckboxes you have checked, it will create three separate e-mails for these\nfiles. Even if you attached them all to one e-mail, the client would receive\nthree separate files. However, with \"Bundle\" on your task list, once it's done\ncreating all of the files (whatever they are) it will then create a PDF bundle\ncontaining all of those files.\nThis file will be named Jobname_Bundle.pdf, and it will be a one-page\nPDF (it uses the Cover Page, adding some instructions for opening files) with\nbookmarks on the left for listing and opening each of the different files that\nwere created.\nIf you have selected e-mail as a task, it will e-mail only the\nJobname_Bundle.PDF, with everything wrapped up in one convenient\npackage.\nIf you want to customize the cover page that appears on the bundle\nand possibly on the multi-page printout including adding graphics, you can,\nusing a simple shortcut. If you create a block file in your block folder called\n\"bundlecover.ecl\" that file will be printed at the beginning of each bundle. A\nfile called \"deliverycover.ecl,\" if it exists, will be printed at the beginning of\neach multi-page document. Eclipse documents can contain any fonts, colors,\ngraphics, boxes, etc., so your cover design options are virtually unlimited.\n630 Eclipse Help\nCreating a Custom bundle type allows you to specify both the contents\nand the name of the bundle extremely specifically. After selecting \"custom\nbundle\" as the type, you are given a field to type in a template for what you\nwant in the bundle. It is up to you to include each thing you want. This can\ninclude PDF files, ASCII files, or any other file you like, and can include\nspecific file names, or file names including the current job being delivered,\nand can allow you to specify the name for the bundle itself. The only two\nspecial commands are as follows:\n%J â replace with the job name\n%B â replace with the job name, and use this for the bundle name\nHere is an example custom bundle template.\nFinal-%B.PDF,%J_MULTI-IX.PDF,%J.TXT,%J-Billing.PDF,OrderForm.png\nWith this example, if you delivered a Smith.ecl job, you would get the\nfollowing:\nSmith_MULTI-IX.PDF (presumably, the multi-page with index)\nSmith.txt (the ASCII)\nSmith-Billing.PDF (A custom billing PDF you created using whatever\nsoftware.)\nOrderForm.png (A generic paper order form image for future orders.)\nAll of the above files will be placed in a bundle named:\nFinal-Smith.PDF\nYou will be prompted to change the description, which allows you to\nsave the changes permanently.\nOther options\nFor the Print, PDF, and ASCII options, the default behavior will be to\nperform those tasks exactly as if you had issued the Print, PDF or ASCII\ncommands normally. In this case, if you change something such as your\nstandard ASCII setup or your multi-page print setup, it will apply to the\ndelivery items as well. If you customize the delivery items further by\npressing the task's settings button, the task will then have its own settings\nindependent of the normal print/ASCII settings. That means that you can\nhave the delivery function automatically print to two different printers, or\nprint one transcript with timecodes and one without, etc. f you then change\nyour normal print/PDF/Multi-page settings, it will not affect the delivery\nfeature tasks that have been customized.\nWhen adding or customizing the e-mail, copy and move functions, you\nwill get essentially the same dialog for all three. It consists of a list of\ncheckboxes for file extensions, such as TXT, PDF, ECL, NOT, etc., which you\ncan select.\nProduction and Delivery of your Transcript 631\nIn addition to the standard file extensions that appear in the\ncheckboxes, you can add any extensions you wish into the Other types:\ndialog, separated by commas, such as \"BRG,SCC\". It also contains a list of\ndestinations. For the e-mail function, adding a destination will ask you for an\ne-mail address. For the copy and move functions, adding a destination will\nask you for a file location. It will default to the file locations already set up,\nbut you can scroll down to the \"browse\" item if you wish to use a folder that\ndoes not have a location defined for it under User\nsettings/Programming/File locations.\nYou can specify exactly which files get transmitted to each separate email\naddress, and once again, you can use the template tokens described\nabove.\nFor example, here is what your \"destination\" list might look like for two\ndifferent clients:\nbob@lawfirm.com,%J_Bundle.pdf,%J_invoice.txt,businesscard.jpg\njoe@freelance.net,%J_MULTI-IX.pdf,joeinvoice.pdf,businesscard.jpg\nThe Find emails button will scan the current document looking for\nanything that looks like an email and add it to the destinations for the\ndelivery feature. Use the Delete button to Remove anyone who should not\nget a copy of the transcript. One use case includes attorney/firm email\naddresses anywhere in the transcript such as the appearance page.\nIf you need to change any part of those e-mail destinations, you can\nhighlight a destination and hit Modify to change it.\n632 Eclipse Help\nThere are no Copy or Move functions defined by default because those\nwill vary tremendously depending on your preferences.\nOne suggestion for using these would be if you intend to deliver copies\nof ASCII files on removable media such as USB drives, in which case you\ncould set up the Copy function to copy the ASCII and/or PDF files to the\nappropriate drive.\nAnother would be to use the Move function to move the job files (ecl,\nnot, dix, wav) into a permanent archive folder after the delivery functions are\ncomplete. Note that if you're going to do this, don't use the BACKUP folder;\nthat's intended for the automatic rotating backups and should be cleared out\nperiodically. You may want to create an archive folder, assign an\nARCHIVE=etc File location to it, then direct the Move task to the ARCHIVE\nfolder.\nYou can add the option to Zip your files. You can select which types of\nfiles to Zip, and assign a new name to the function, such as \"Zipped\ntranscripts plus audio.\" Your zip file will be created at the location specified in\nUser settings/Programming/File locations. Your existing files will not be\nmoved, and you can still copy or move them, or perform other actions on the\nfiles.\nSome final notes on this feature: It will only deliver \"jobs,\" not arbitrary\nfiles. In other words, it allows you to select transcripts (ecl files) from your\nJOB folder and nowhere else. All of the delivery features assume that the\nASCII files, PDF files, etc., are all stored in the JOB folder for the purpose of\ne-mailing, copying and moving.\nIt automates the order of the tasks so you don't need to worry about\nthat. Printing will come first, followed by ASCII, followed by e-mail and copy,\nfollowed by move. You will notice this if you add a print task; it will be added\nwith the other print tasks. It's done this way so that tasks like printing to a\nPDF file and creating an ASCII is done before it tries to e-mail or copy the\nresulting PDF or TXT files.\n19.4 PDF Output\nPDF Output\nRELATES TO: Print , Print dialog , Multipage\nprint dialog .\nThe Output to PDF menu item is on the Production menu, under the Output\nto Ascii function. There is a toolbar button which you can add to your toolbar, along\nwith the \"Delivery\" button, using the Window/Customize toolbars function. You\ncan also right-click in any toolbar to open the Customize toolbars dialog.\n600 601\n610\n951\nProduction and Delivery of your Transcript 633\nWith this feature you do not need to use PDFcreator or CutePDF or any other\nprinter-driver-based system for creating PDF files.\nTo set the location for where your pdfs will be created, go to User\nSettings/Programming/File Locations, select Add and choose PDF (Portable\ndocuments) from the \"Pick one\" list. Click OK and you will be prompted to select a\nlocation for your pdf files. This location will be used for both the pdfs created using\nthe Production menu/Output to pdf, and the Delivery dialog.\nWhen you create a PDF of a note file or dictionary, the software will open the\nPDF file once it's complete so that you can review it.\nThe PDF dialog has a \"Name\" option that allows you to rename the PDF to\nsomething that does not precisely match the job name. This was necessary in order to\nprovide different versions of the PDF, such as a standard and PDF/A version, or a\nconfidential and redacted version, or multiple independent volumes, or any other\nreason.\nThis \"name\" option defaults to %J which is the name of the job. If you had a\nSmith.ecl file and wished to create a Smith-redacted version of the file, you could\nsimply use %J-redacted.\nNote that the jobname_MULTI and other .pdf suffixes are still applied by the\ndelivery feature when creating multiple PDF files.\nIf you are using the delivery feature in conjunction with this feature, note that\neven though you can specify a different name for each delivery task, these alternate\nPDFs will NOT be included in the bundle if you choose to bundle the document, nor\nwill they be e-mailed or archived. Only the files with the exact jobname and optional\n_suffix will be included. This is expected behavior, since alternate PDFs would\ngenerally be going to a different audience and should not be bundled with the main\njob. (Redacted and confidential versions never go to the same person, PDF/A is for\narchiving and not litigation, etc., etc.)\nThe Print image options button allows you to access the details of how the PDF\nwill be created, using the same dialog that you use for printing. The options all work\nexactly the same way, because a PDF is a file version of a printout, and you can\naccess the same options for creating a PDF that you do for printing, including the\ndraft watermark, the multi-page options, etc.\nNote that If you have a \"start new page number\" at the beginning of the\ndocument, that will force the PDF file to start with the page number indicated rather\nthan starting with 1.\n634 Eclipse Help\nThe Create PDF dialog contains a number of PDF-specific options:\nPDF digital signatures\nIn the Create PDF dialog, there is a Signature file item, followed by a Browse\nbutton. You can use this to select your digital signature file, which must be a .pfx file.\nYou must purchase a digital signature from a TTP (Trusted Third-Party) validation\nservice such as GlobalSign or EnTrust. Contact tech support for details.\nBelow that line, there is a Signer location where you can fill in the location\nwhere the PDF document was created (signed).\nThere is also a Signer e-mail where you can fill in your e-mail address, which\nwill be published as contact information in the signed PDF. You can also add other\ncontact information here, if you wish, such as a phone number and/or address. Just\nbe aware that PDF readers may not allow a huge amount of room to display this\ninformation in their dialogs.\nPDF concordance indexing\nIf you create a PDF of a full-sized document with index or a multi-page\ndocument with index, the PDF file will contain the index as a separate pane of\nbookmarks with automatic access to each word in the document. When the PDF is\nopened, the bookmarks pane is automatically displayed.\nOpening the letter group shows each word starting with that letter. Clicking on a\nword triggers the query function on that word and will show a clickable example of\nevery instance of that word in context in the document.\nProduction and Delivery of your Transcript 635\nInclude auto-index items\nIf you use the automatic indexing feature in Eclipse, there are a couple of\nhelpful hooks that will allow that information to be used by the PDF creation feature.\nIn order to use the auto-index material, first the PDF feature needs to know\nwhere the index items belong. Since that information is no longer present in the text\nwhen the index is inserted, the auto-index feature will put in \"hints\" to the PDF\nfeature telling it where the items came from. When you generate an index, you will\nsee index lines actually inserted into the index itself, at the beginning of each group,\nsuch as In:EXAM, In:PLEXBT and In:DFEXBT.\nThe PDF feature can detect when it comes across an index line and will insert it\ninto the bookmarks under the appropriate index name.\nFor each item, it will show the page/line number where it appears, and have a\nclickable bookmark allowing the reader to jump to that page.\nAdditionally, you can get the PDF indexing to create a bookmark for every\nmention of an index item, rather than simply linking to the specific items enumerated\nin the index.\nIf you add an index line immediately below the one naming the index itself, you\ncan specify a wildcard, using the * in place of the item. For example, you might have\nsomething like the following:\nIn:EXHIBITS\nIn:Exhibit *\nINDEX OF EXHIBITS\nEx. No. description Page\n1 A contract 6\n2 A letter 14\nIn an index with this format, the index items are simply \"1\" and \"2\", or \"A\" and\n\"B\", etc., so searching for those isn't particularly helpful. The wildcard that was\nadded, \"Exhibit *\", tells the PDF creator to look for \"Exhibit 1\" and \"Exhibit 2\" and\n\"Exhibit A\", etc., as it's creating the document. Note that if your index items are\nalready uniquely searchable (let's say your items actually look like \"Exhibit 1\" or\n\"Exhibit 2\") then your wildcard should just be * and nothing else. The item is enough.\nWhen it sees matching text anywhere in the document, it will make an\nadditional bookmark for that instance, filed under the appropriate index type.\nIn place of index descriptions such as PLEXAM or DFEXBT, you can supply a\ndescription for the index that is one line, abbreviated as much as possible, in its own\nfile. For example, if you create a file called PLEXAM_DESC.ecl in your block files folder,\nand type into it \"Plaintiff's Examinations,\" that will be used as the label for the PDF\nbookmarks in that group.\n636 Eclipse Help\nPDF embedded exhibit files\nYou can embed exhibit files directly in your PDF transcript.\nGo to any point in the document and use Insert print command (Alt+N) and\nyou will see a print command called \"Attachment.\"\nSelect that command and hit [enter] and you will be given a file dialog. Select a\nfile and it will be attached to the document in the current position. There is an\nATTACHMENT=etc. File location that remembers where you browsed to when you\nattached a file. Attachments are not required to be in that location. This simply makes\nthe process of attaching multiple files from the same place more convenient.\nIt works best with other .pdf files, and often PDFs are used for exhibits because\nthe digital signatures allow the authenticity to be verified. However, you can just as\neasily embed .jpg pictures, .txt ASCII files, audio files, video files, etc.\nYou can review that the attachment works by placing your cursor in the\nattachment print command and hitting [enter]. That should open the file just as a\nuser would see it.\nWhen you create the PDF, these attached files will appear in a separate\nattachments pane (the paperclip icon in Adobe Reader) and can be accessed directly\nthat way.\nYou will also get a \"Contents\" bookmark group above the index which will list\neach of the files. Each file will have sub-bookmarks: One to open the file, and another\nclickable link describing the page and line number in the document where it appears\nthat can jump right to it.\nOn the page where the attachment appears, a clickable link will appear to the\nleft of the line number where the attachment was added in the document. This\nhotspot will also open the attachment. So, clients using the PDF will have several\nways to open the attachments: the attachments pane, the \"open file\" bookmark, and\nthe clickable link. You can customize the colors/font/bold/italic for the link by going to\nUser settings/Document/Advanced and changing the \"Attachment\" font. The\ndefault setting is blue underscored attachment links, mimicking default web browser\nlinks.\nAttachments and Index items appear in the same order as in the original index.\nPDF embedded exhibit / auto-index linking\nThe minimum you need to do to attach files to a PDF is Insert the print\ncommand, Attachment, and select the file.\nYou then use the Eclipse automatic indexing features to associate these files\nwith specific exhibit numbers, with particular index items, indicate where they're\nmentioned in the document, and put the hotspot rectangle around the appropriate\ntext.\nFor best results, add them to the index items after they're generated.\nUsing the earlier example, but this time with attachments added:\nIn:EXHIBITS\nProduction and Delivery of your Transcript 637\nIn:Exhibit *\nINDEX OF EXHIBITS\nEx. No. description Page\nAt:{DOC}Exhibits\\Jones\\12-13 Contract.pdf\n1 A contract 6\nAt:{DOC]Exhibits\\Jones\\IMG2023.jpg\n2 A letter 14\nThis same index now has an attachment added immediately above each index.\nThe PDF creator now knows what index items these attachments are associated\nwith, and will automatically put the hotspot rectangle around the item, so in this case,\nthere will be a rectangle around the \"1\" and the \"2\" (again, if you have verbose item\nnames, like \"Exhibit 1\", the rectangle will be around the entire item.)\nIn addition, as the PDF creator is going through the document finding the index\nwildcards, it will not only make a bookmark, but will also draw a clickable hotspot\naround every instance in the transcript that will open the attachment, as well. (Note:\nThe clickable hotspots don't appear on the multi-page output. There's just no space\non a compressed page. The attachment pane is still available, however.)\nMultiple wildcard lines: In the index, you can create several lines of\nwildcards and each of them will be searched to find the index item. For example, you\nmight have:\nExhibit *\nPlaintiff's *\nDefendant's *\nand this will find any instance where the word in question appears. Note that these\nare case-sensitive, so they will find only instances of exhibits, not the word appearing\nin a sentence.\nPDF encryption and protection\nThe PDF format has a built-in mechanism for protecting the contents of PDF\nfiles. You can specifically allow or prohibit the user of the PDF file from printing,\ncopying or annotating the file.\nThe Create PDF dialog has checkboxes for each of these options, allowing you to\ncontrol what your clients are (legally) permitted to do with the PDF file once they get\nit.\n638 Eclipse Help\nPDF/A-1b compliance\nPlease do NOT check this box unless you are required to. It disables many of the\nother features in the PDF export, such as the encryption that prevents users from\naccessing certain features, the search query bookmarks and the file attachment\nhotspots.\nThe reason for this is that PDF/A is a stripped-down version of PDF for the sake\nof compatibility and archiving. Court systems may ask for PDFs to be created in this\nformat as future-proofing to ensure that the PDF files will always be readable in future\nversions of PDF readers.\nEclipse adapts to some of this by creating individual generic bookmarks for each\nindex item, and the attachments are still available in the attachments pane, but other\nitems are disabled.\nUse display colors\nYou can check this box to print all text to the PDF in the colors that would\nnormally be used only on the display. It also uses the background color, if it is\ndifferent from the page background color. This allows proofreaders and other editors\nto be able to review the PDF with color cues normally only visible on the Eclipse\nscreen. These colors will also appear on a color printout if you print the PDF to\nphysical paper on a color printer.\nProduction and Delivery of your Transcript 639\nVISUALIZERS:\nI6a_PDF_Options\nI7_Digital_Signature_Setup\nI7a_Digital_Signature_Use\nI1a_Delivery\n19.5 Zip Files\nWorking With ZIP FILES\nRELATES TO: File Manager .\nA \"zipped\" file is a compressed version of one or more files. Zipping files\nmakes them smaller and easier to transfer.\nIf you have zipped a file, or received a .ZIP file from someone else, it\nmust be unzipped before it can be worked with in Eclipse.\nYou can zip or unzip files in the file manager . When you do this,\nthey will always be unzipped in the same folder. So if you want to work with\nthe contents of a zip file you received from someone else, place the ZIP file in\nyour Jobs folder, and unzip it there.\nYou may also work with ZIP files outside of Eclipse. (In fact, ZIP is a\nworldwide computing standard.) If you try to unzip a file in Windows\nExplorer, or anywhere else, the WinZip program will run. More advanced\nactions, such as zipping entire folders or zipping across multiple floppy disks,\ncan be done from with WinZip. WinZip has its own help system.\nAbout Audio Files\nDo not zip audio files. They are already compressed, and zipping them\nwill not help. In fact, it is a good idea to add WAV to the list of file types\nthat are excluded from a ZIP .\nAny other Eclipse file type may be zipped.\n677\n680\n682\n640 Eclipse Help\nWinZip is a registered trademark of WinZip International LLC.\nPython Plugins 641\n20 Python Plugins\nPython Plugins\nSupport/Plugins\nThe Python programming language plugin system has been added to\nEclipse 11.\nThis is found under Support/Plugins and contains various functions for editing and\ncreating plugins.\nPlugins can be used as simply as downloading a single file, or can be large and\ncomplex systems requiring a special installer.

The\npause button will remain pressed until it is unpaused (or until play is pressed). It will\npreserve your current playback position, so when you un-pause or hit play, it will\ncontinue from where it stopped rather than starting at the current position.\nIf you wish to pause and continue, you should use the pause button.

Mark the block of text to be redacted, open\nthe Control Panel (Audio playback controls - Ctrl+Shift+A) and select Redact. The\nRedact audio dialog opens. Click Start to begin playing the audio for the marked\ntext, and use the slider and Mark button to select the exact place you want the\nredaction to begin. Do the same for the End of the redacted audio. Itwill redact both\nthe audio AND the text that is marked. Note that doing this will remove the audio\nPERMANENTLY from the .wav file. It is recommended that you make a copy of the\n.wav file if you need to preserve the original, unredacted version.\nAudio redaction can use a tone instead of silence. If you wish for redacted audio\nnot to simply be dead air, record a few seconds of data in exactly the same codec that\nis being used to deliver redacted audio content. Place this short audio file in the\nProgram Files (x86)/Advantage Software/Eclipse folder and rename it to\n\"Redacted.wav\". An excerpt of this data will be used to replace the audio highlighted\nby the redact audio feature.\nThe first time you redact audio, it will automatically create a\njobname_redacted.wav file. This file is the one that will have redacted audio. Note\nthat when you finish redacting, the redacted auto will auto-play starting a couple of\nseconds before the redaction so that you can doublecheck that the redaction worked\nproperly. Normally, the play function will play the unredacted jobname.wav file. If you\nwish to play back the redacted version, set the playback channel to \"redacted\" which\nis a choice on the droplist below the last channel on the Audio playback controls.\nFile Size Issues\nThe best solution for audio file size issues is to choose Opus for your\nrecordings. It compresses extremely high quality 48000hz, 16-bit audio, which would\nnormally be about 350mb per hour, down to about 25mb per hour with virtually no\naudible quality loss. For more on Opus, see the reference guide page.\nOther audio files are, by definition, very large. Zipping them will not make\nthem smaller; they are already compressed. If you want to share audio files with a\nscopist, or archive them, you will need to invest in a large-capacity storage medium,\nsuch as a CD burner external hard drive, or thumb drive.\nWAV files are too large be emailed, unless you are using a specialty large-file\nemailing service.\nIf you frequently record audio, you must be judicious about deleting or archiving\naudio files from completed jobs. At the default size of 8 kilobytes per second, it only\ntakes about 40 hours of recorded sound to consume 1 gigabyte of hard drive space. If\nyou let these files accumulate on your hard drive, it will soon fill up, which leads to\npoor computer performance.\nVISUALIZERS:\nAudio Recording Test\nAudio Recording Test - Windows XP\nMonitoring Your Microphone\n700\n700\n639\nWorking With... 657\nAudio Recording and Playback\nAudio Auto-Stop/Play\nAudio Recording and Playback\nAudio Adjustments\nAudio Offset\nMulti-Channel Audio\nMulti-Channel Playback\n21.1.1 Windows Audio Capture\nWindows Audio Capture\nWorking with Audio\n21.1.2 Footpedals to control audio\nUsing Footpedals to\ncontrol Audio\nWorking with Audio\nInterfacing with the X-Keys & Infiniti 2 and 3 foodpedals,\nto play macros that manipulate audio.\nIf you have the X-Keys or Infinity 2 or 3 foodpedal, Eclipse can interact\nwith it directly using macros for manipulating audio.\nYou must have the footpedal plugged in before running Eclipse.

It can record up to sixteen sound files at\nthe same time.\nUse case examples:\n1) Multiple audio devices leading to separate, individual microphones to create a\nmulti-channel recording wherein each channel is a separate recording from only that\nmicrophone, such as one for the room, one for the judge and one for the witness.\n1064\n1033\n483 269\n1184\n660 Eclipse Help\n2) Multiple recordings being made from the same audio device simultaneously.\nFor example, recording a low-quality, small-file format for the purpose of streaming to\na remote scopist, but recording a high-quality, large-file format for the reporter to use\nfor their own editing that will not be sent over the Internet.\n3) A separate voice audio backup for voicewriters, allowing channel 1 to be the\nroom audio, and channel 2 to be a WAV copy of the same mask or microphone voice\naudio that Dragon Naturally Speaking is using for the voicewriter recognition.\nWAV files recorded from built-in and/or USB audio devices allows you to have up\nto 16 multiple recordings going on at the same time.\nA multi-channel audio recording will have a separate WAV file for each channel.\nWhen only using one channel. it will be jobname.wav. Further channels will be named\njobname_2.wav, jobname_3.wav, etc. The system is limited to 8 separate channels.\nKeep in mind that each one could be recording in stereo for a total of 16 separate\naudio channels.\nThe audio user interface has several features that enable this functionality:\nUnder User settings/Realtime, all of the audio options are in a dialog that is\naccessed by pressing the Audio recording.. button.\nThis dialog contains the following controls:\nÂ· Auto-pause, Auto-restart and Levels buttons.\nÂ· Audio Device drop-list allows you to select what device the current channel is\nusing to record.\nÂ· Select Compression button allows you to select what codec to use for the\ncurrent channel.\nNote that both of the above controls work exactly as if you are using only one\nchannel of recording.\nWorking With... 661\nHowever, you can hit the Add channel button to add new channels to the list.\nNew channels will default to PCM, 11khz. The list will show the channel number, the\ndevice being recorded, the codec, and the storage rate in megabytes per hour (bytes\nper second seems less useful.)\nYou can use the up or down arrows to the right of the Add channel button to\nmove a channel up or down the list. When you select a channel on the list, you can\nthen use the Audio device selection drop list and the Select compression button to\nchoose the device and codec for that channel.\nThe Delete channel button will delete the currently selected channel. Note that\nyou cannot delete all of the channels.\nNote that it is possible to make multiple recordings from the same device\nsource, as described in the use cases. If you want to record high-quality/low-quality,\ncreate two channels with the same device input but different compression selections.\nVoicewriters should use channel 1 for the room audio and can select the voicewriting\nUSB device (such as the Andrea) for channel 2, even though Dragon is using it at the\nsame time.\nIf you wish to use multiple microphones in separate locations in the room, keep\nin mind that this sort of multi-channel recording requires a separate audio device for\neach microphone. For example, to record room, judge and witness in three separate\nchannels, you could use your computer's built-in microphone in channel 1, then use a\nUSB audio device with a microphone plugged into it for the judge, and a separate USB\naudio device with a microphone plugged into it for the witness. You can use a USB\nhub if your computer doesn't have enough USB ports. IMPORTANT: Multiple audio\njacks are NOT separate audio devices. If your computer or your USB device has a\nmicrophone jack and a line-in jack, those are NOT two separate devices and you\ncannot use them to record two separate independent channels.\nAlso note that for all features in Eclipse other than record/playback, the software\nwill ONLY look at channel 1. For example, the feature that copies segments of the\n.wav file to the DIVISIONS folder, the audio sharing through Connection Magic, the\nlevel indicators on the infobar and the realtime window, etc., are all features that will\nonly reflect what is going on on channel 1. For that reason, channel 1 should always\nbe the primary recording. That will be the copy that your scopist gets automatically.\nYou can still give a scopist the extra channels manually at a later time, which would\nbe recommended anyway since it will take significant additional time to send that\nmany additional WAV files.\nUnder User settings/Edit, there is an Audio playback.. button that accesses\nthe multimedia control panel (\"Audio playback controls\").\n662 Eclipse Help\nThis dialog contains the same Speed and Threshold controls that it did before,\nbut new controls have been added:\nThe Channel drop-list allows you to select which audio channel you are playing.\nThe default is 1. There is also an \"all\" selection which will play all the channels at\nonce. You might think that using \"all\" should be the default, and of course you can set\nit that way, but for many applications, this would not be good, such as the\nsimultaneous high/low quality recordings or the simultaneous room/voice recordings.\nAnd even for the multiple microphone setups, be aware that if there is any\nmicrophone cross-talk, playing all channels simultaneously could result in oddsounding\nechoes depending on the performance characteristics of your hardware and\nsoftware. Multi-microphone setups should consider the possibility of either a unified\nroom mic as channel 1 or a mixed version of the sound as channel 1, leaving that as\nthe default and only using the separated channels in order to disambiguate\novertalking when the sound is otherwise undecipherable. If you intend to use the \"all\"\noption to play all of the channels simultaneously, it is strongly recommended that you\nmake sure that all of the channels are using identical compression settings.\nThe Device drop-list allows you to select which audio device you are playing\nthrough. Most of the time, you should leave this at the default, which will play\nthrough your computer's speakers. However, some users plug in separate USB audio\ndevices that have their own playback headset ports, and you may decide that you get\nbetter playback with that.\nIf you find yourself frequently switching playback channels in editing, you may\nfind it advantageous to create some hotkey macros that perform [control\npanel/channel X/OK] all in one keystroke (check the \"play on exit\" option to eliminate\nthe need to add the play button to the macro.)\nIn addition, there is an Auto checkbox next to the channel selector. If you have\nthat checked, then when you hit play anywhere in a document, Eclipse will look at the\nparagraph that the cursor is on. If it's an Answer, it will assume that the speaker is\nTHE WITNESS (or whatever you have entered under User settings/Translate/Convert\nANSWER to.) If you're on a colloquy, it will know the name. If you're on a question, it\nwill scan back to the most recent by line.\nChannel ignore feature\nWorking With... 663\nIf you left-click on the waveform of one channel in a multi-channel recording, it\nwill toggle on and off an indication that reads *IGNORED*. This channel will be\nignored for purposes of transcription. That means that it will be omitted from the mix,\nwhich also has the result that it will not be sent to team editors or be analyzed by\nspeech engines. Helpfully, however, the jobname_channelnumber audio file WILL still\nhave a recording of what the person said while they were being ignored in case you do\nneed to go back and review it and possibly add it to the transcript.\nThis ignore feature is especially helpful if you have situations where many\npeople are individually miked and have frequent side-conversations with the person\nnext to them when they're not supposed to be on the record. While many\nmicrophones have a mute function to prevent this, the attendees may not know this\nor may not use it, or may not cover the mic, etc. This not only gets chatter into the\nmix, but also dumps data into speech features such as Boost.\nIt can also be helpful during breaks so that the assistant/record are not\nrecording off-the-record chatter. Note that if you \"ignore\" the MIX channel, this\nmerely prevents it from being sent to the speech engine, but does not stop it from\nrecording.\nIf you go to Tools menu/Edit toggles, you can click the Audio channel\ntoggles button to open a pick list, which shows all the current channels, and\nwhether they are on or off. Each one has a one-key shortcut to turn it on or off. If you\nuse this frequently, you could write a macro to facilitate this process.\nASIO (Audio Stream Input/Output)\nASIO is an industry standard created by Steinberg for multi-channel audio\nrecording devices for the music industry. It makes it possible to use an extremely\nlarge variety of audio interfaces.\n664 Eclipse Help\nThere is an \"Advanced\" audio input mechanism, and all devices supported by\nthis mechanism will start with A:devicename in the list of input devices. When it's\navailable, make sure to select the one with ASIO in the name.\nThis interface type perfectly synchronizes the samples in each channel so that\nthey can be played simultaneously without echo, and also ensuring the integrity of\nthe mix. It's especially useful when recording large numbers of channels such as 12\nor 16.\nStereo audio recording will automatically split into two separate\nmono .wav file channels and allow mixing\nMost multi-channel audio recording devices set up stereo devices where the left\nchannel is one input and the right channel is another. A four-channel recorder will\nhave two devices, one for channels 1-2 and another for 3-4. In order for this to create\nthe most useful possible set of recordings in Eclipse, Eclipse will automatically split\nthese devices into two separate mono .wav file channels. It also allows you to create a\nmix channel that recombines all of the available channels into a single mix, including\naudio from multiple single-channel devices, such as built-in microphones on laptops.\nWhen you select a device for recording, rather than selecting mono or stereo,\nyou can select an \"input\" from a separate droplist. That allows you to select which\ninput you're recording. So if you have devices A and B, each of which has two inputs,\nyou create four channels in Eclipse: A-input 1, A-input 2, B-input 1, B-input 2 (and\nit's recommended that channel 0 be a mix, so it will be (default)-input Mix)\nUsing the Seating Chart to determine the best audio to play\nSo now that it knows who was speaking, how does it know which audio channel\nto play? In order to know that, it will have to know where the speakers were in\nrelation to the microphones that were set up around the room.\nOpen the seating chart, and if you have auto-channel selected, the seating\nchart will ensure that you have a separate MICROPHONE object for each audio channel\nthat you recorded.\n261\nWorking With... 665\nDrag the microphones to the approximate locations where the microphones were\nin the room relative to the speakers. Once that's set up, hitting the play button will\nalways play the audio from the microphone closest to the person who was speaking at\nthe cursor position.\nNote that the audio channel auto-selection won't work if there are no\nmicrophone positions established, so Eclipse will prompt you for the Seating Chart if\nyou have not set up the positions.\nIf you are using an ASR with the multi-channel audio recording and the mix\nchannel, the mix channel gets sent to the ASR. When the audio comes back, Eclipse\nautomatically identifies the speakers by looking at which microphone had the loudest\ninput at the timestamps where each word occurred. This results in close to 100%\naccuracy in identifying speakers when they have separate microphones. Note that\nthese will appear as MIC1, MIC2, MIC3 in the voisteno, so it's recommended that you\nhave MIC1 = {S:SPEAKER01} dictionary entries, or whatever makes sense for your\nparticular use case scenario.\nNew multi-channel recording player interface\nAnother option for multi-channel recording is The Liberty Court Player, a multichannel\nsystem for recording audio in a courtroom, along with video. It can record\neach microphone in the room in a separate audio channel, allowing you to isolate\nindividual voices during playback.\nDetails of the player are here:\nhttp://www.libertyrecording.com/LCR_main.htm\nYou can download the player here:\nhttp://www.libertyrecording.com/download/lcr70pe.msi.zip\n666 Eclipse Help\nKeep in mind that the player is free, but the recording software is a commercial\nproduct. If you are considering doing multi-channel recording, you should contact the\ncompany and find out more about the kind of equipment that will be required.\nNormally, they work with courts directly. If you already work in a courthouse that uses\nthis system, you're all set. If not, you may want to discuss with them options for\nsetting up a system for yourself, possibly with portable equipment, and what the cost\nmight be for such a system, hardware and software included. Audio recording is an\narea with a great deal of variation depending on the customers' needs.\nEclipse will support synchronized playback using the Liberty Court Player. In\nother words, if you have a multi-channel recording recorded with this system, you can\nload the recording into the player in the background and Eclipse will recognize this.\nWhen you are editing the transcript in Eclipse and you hit the play button, instead of\nplaying a .wav file, it will command the Liberty Court Player to play the multi-channel\nrecording at the timecode corresponding to the cursor location.\nSetting this up does require a couple of extra steps since the interface between\nthe two programs is itself in the early beta test stages. If you are interested in trying\nthis out, contact ASI at support@eclipsecat.com and we'll get you the additional\ninstructions that are necessary.\n21.3 Captioning\nWorking With CAPTIONING\nRELATES TO: Working With Realtime ,\nWorking With Realtime Output , Working\nWith Multiple Dictionaries , Phone Book ,\nSend Script Line .\nAccuCap is the captioning-enabled version of Eclipse.

Encoders operate at very slow speeds compared to\nmodern internet modems. If you attempt to connect to a captioning encoder with a\nmodern internet modem, you will probably get bad results. Be sure to ask for this\ntype of modem. Advantage Software tech support can give you a more detailed list of\nrecommended modem brands.\nAlso, you will need a COM port to plug the modem into. If you don't have enough\nCOM ports, see realtime hardware for information on how to produce another\none.\nYou may also connect to an encoder via direct cable. The setup for this is very\nsimilar to setting up CIC; see the page on CIC output options .\nOnce all hardware and settings are in place, the Phone Book allows you to\ndial into an encoder.\nDictionaries\nCaptioners must be proficient at working with multiple dictionaries . They\nwill generally build small dictionaries specific to the type of show they are covering,\nsuch as a dictionary of world leaders for use in news programs, and a dictionary of\ncaptioning entries. This allows you to pick-and-choose extra dictionaries for each job.\nFor example, if you cover sports news, you may want to keep \"general baseball terms\"\nseparate from \"general hockey terms\"; by doing so, you can use one without the other\nif need be (such as for a hockey game, in which baseball terms are unlikely to be\nused).\nFurthermore, captioners must be skilled with the glue alphabet , as they will\nfrequently have to write words that are not in their dictionary, such as unexpected\nnames.\nOther dictionary entries that captioners will need:\nSyntax What It Does Suggested Location\n{BLANK} Blanks the captioning display. separate dictionary of captioning\nterms\n{FLUSH}\nForces all buffered text to the\noutput, overriding Flush Word\nDelay .\nseparate dictionary of captioning\nterms\n487\n520\n523\n484\n522\n1038\n675\n960\n523\n668 Eclipse Help\n{^} Delete space.

It\nis common to use STKPWHR and\n-FRPBLGTS for these items.\nBlock, Passthrough, and other Modes\n960\n375\nWorking With... 669\nYou must manually change the mode of the encoder between Block and\nPassthrough. Block means that only your captions will be accepted: Passthrough\nmeans that other caption sources will take precedence. In practice, you will switch to\nPassthrough during commercials, and then Block when the show is back on.\nThe following keystrokes invoke these, and other useful modes:\nÂ· F6 - Block.\nÂ· F2 - Passthrough.\nÂ· F3 - Blank and Pass.\nÂ· F4 - Suspend toggle. (When in suspend mode, nothing you write will be sent. Use\nthis mode to quickly write and global entries during a break.)\nSee the AccuCap addendum in the Eclipse Documentation for more details.\nScripting\nWith any text file open, the Send Script Line (F12) command will send a\nline to the encoder. This allows you to use existing files as scripts.\nTo prepare an open text file for use as a script, you can use the Format\nmenu/Document utility feature Format script. It will format the entire document\nyou are in. If you mark a block before executing this function, it will only format the\ntext in the block. It breaks up all of the text into new paragraphs at every terminal\npunctuation mark, which is every location in the document where any of the following\nsymbols [.?!:] is followed by two spaces.\nIf the current script paragraph doesn't have steno associated with each line,\nthen in order to timecode each line in the realtime document, the send script line\ncommand MUST create a new paragraph for each line. This is necessary to eliminates\nduplicate timecodes\nScript lines that are sent to the encoder are also added to the realtime\ntranslation. If your job is a combination of scripted and live-written material, the\ntranscript file will reflect both.\nScripts can also accept commands. Insert a Script Command , and type the\nfollowing codes into the command to produce the following actions:\nÂ· B - blank\nÂ· M|P - switch to pop-on captions (typical for credit files)\nÂ· M|R - switch to roll-up captions\nÂ· P|X,Y - change vertical position. X is the starting row, Y is the number of rows.\nÂ· S|NAME - assigns a name to this section. For use with the Script List Manager .\nYou can also use the Script List Manager to handle scripting.\n326\n31\n694 1055\n367\n1052\n1052\n670 Eclipse Help\nExporting your files\nThe File/Export function includes three options for captioners. At times, you\nwill need to export the text of a completed captioning session. For example, there is a\nlegal requirement to provide captions on any Internet-distributed video if the original\nbroadcast version of the video had captions on it.\nÂ· SCC captioning - Files in this format can be imported by a number of off-line\ncaptioning software products such as the CPC software. Some encoding\nhardware can directly import .scc files and encode the captions stored in them\ndirectly to video without using any additional software. SCC files contain\ntimecodes and captions, so you can do a live captioning job, go back and clean\nup the text, and then provide a .scc file to the station so that they can burn\nthe edited captions on the stored copy of the program for later distribution.\nÂ· SMPTE-TT is a specialized type of XML output that is used for web-based offline\ncaptioning. Like the .scc output, this is being used by many companies in\norder to comply with the regulations for providing off-line versions of on-line\ncaptions when videos are published on the web.\nÂ· SAMI files are used for post-production captioning on Windows Media player\nfiles.\nVISUALIZERS:\nL4 - AccuCAP\nL4a - YouTube\n21.4 Conversions\nWorking With\nCONVERSIONS\nRELATES TO: Import , Export , Convert .\nEclipse allows you to convert note files , text files , and dictionaries to\na variety of useful, non-Eclipse formats.\nConverting files can be done via one of three commands in Eclipse:\nÂ· Import : Import an external file into an Eclipse file.\nÂ· Export : Export an Eclipse file to a non-Eclipse format.\nÂ· Convert : Allows you to do a complete conversion to or from another file format,\nvia a series of prompts.\nTypes of Conversions\nGenerally speaking, you have the ability to convert to and from the following file\ntypes:\n990 966 948\n224 694 672\n990\n966\n948\nWorking With... 671\nÂ· RTF/CRE. RTF for short, this format is a means of conveying files to/from other CAT\nsystems.\nÂ· ASCII. A generic text file that can be viewed/edited in any text editor program. Can\nbe used for conversions, but RTF/CRE is superior. Uses the TXT extension. (Note: If\nyou simply want to create an ASCII file of a transcript, use the Output To ASCII\noption.\nÂ· Eclipse Version 8. Files from Eclipse Version 8 (DOS) and Eclipse are not\ninterchangeable (even though some use the same extensions ). These files need\nto be converted into Eclipse files.\nÂ· SDF or SDIF. An older protocol for file conversions. Use only if you are converting\nto/from a system that supports only this method.\nÂ· Other CAT systems. The Convert menu item allows you to work directly with\nnative file formats of other CAT systems.\nÂ· Other file formats. You can create files that serve other useful purposes, such as\ninstalling a dictionary onto a Stentura 8000 writer, or creating an HTML file of a\ntranscript that can be viewed in a web browser.\nFor more details on each of these file types, see the individual pages on\nImport , Export , and Convert .\nConverting To/From Other CAT Systems\nFor best results, follow these rules when converting files to/from other CAT\nsystems:\nÂ· Use RTF/CRE whenever possible. The RTF standard was designed with inter-CAT\nsystem conversions in mind. Each CAT system has the ability to export to, and\nimport from, RTF. If you want to receive a file from another CAT system, export the\nfile to RTF from that system. Then, import from RTF to Eclipse. Likewise, when\nexporting to a different CAT system, it is best to export to RTF, and then use that\nsystem to import from RTF.\nÂ· Set your margins to match. When importing from RTF, Eclipse will use your\nsettings on the Document tab and Paragraphs tab , rather than the margin\nsettings called for in the RTF file itself. If it is crucial that the margins not change,\nset your Eclipse margins to match what the other CAT system used.\nÂ· Clean up or remake title pages. Title pages don't convert well, because different\nCAT systems have very different ways of handling them. You will likely have to fix\nthem up, or remake them.\nVISUALIZERS:\nJ4 - Convert Files\nH4 - Dictionary Export\nH9 - Passport Dictionary Conversion\nP6c - Passport Touch Dictionary\nI6 - Bridge Mobile Proofreading\nD1a - Extended Steno Dictionary Conversion\n622\n971\n948\n990 966 948\n434 447\n672 Eclipse Help\n21.5 Dictionaries\nWorking With...\nDICTIONARIES\nRELATES TO: Build Dictionary , Dictionary\nentry syntax , Dictionaries dialog , Open\nDictionary , AutoMagic in a Dictionary ,\nDictionary Filter , Working With Multiple\nDictionaries .\nA dictionary is a list of steno outlines and their equivalent definitions. Dictionaries\nmay also contain text globals .\nWhen you translate a job or do realtime , the steno translates against your\nmain dictionary, and one or more additional dictionaries.\nTo enter a dictionary, press F9 and then select the dictionary you want to work\nwith. If you have an Eclipse text file open when you press F9, you will select the\ndesired dictionary from the Dictionaries dialog . If not, you will select from the\nstandard file dialog . You can also create a new dictionary from the file dialog by\nentering the name you wish to give the new dictionary.\nYour dictionary entries must follow a certain syntax . There are codes for\nQ/A/speakers, punctuation, autoinclude entries, and other useful commands.\nOnce inside a dictionary, you can perform any of the following actions:\nÂ· Move around, using the applicable basic cursor movements . Other ways to\nmove around are described below.\nÂ· Add new entries, using Add Dictionary Entry (Ctrl+D). Attempting a global\nwhile in a dictionary file will do the same thing.\nÂ· Filter the dictionary.\nÂ· Edit existing dictionary entries .\nÂ· Change the appearance of your dictionary files.\nThe Dictionaries dialog also allows you to select and use dictionaries beyond\nthe Main dictionary. It can be accessed from the User Tab of User Settings, the\nTranslate Notes dialog, or by pressing F9 with a text file active.\nIf you are a new reporting student and have no main dictionary, you can create a\n2000-entry starter dictionary via Build Dictionary .\nMoving around in a dictionary\n151\n958 955\n1035 214\n197\n675\n1062\n269 483\n694\n955\n969\n958\n312\n173 326\n197\n143\n142\n955\n101\n269 694\n151\nWorking With... 673\nIf you are in a dictionary and you press a letter, you will jump to the first entry\nthat uses that letter's steno equivalent. It prefers left-side phonetics, so when you hit\n\"L\" you will get the entries starting with HR, not the entries starting with the rightside\n-L key. There are a relatively small number of right-side-only entries in a\ndictionary, and they all appear at the top, so it makes sense to skip those.\nIf you have sorted the dictionary by text, you will jump to the first entry that\nstarts with that text. It is case-sensitive, and you can type multiple letters to jump to\nthe first entries that start with those letters as a sequence. After a one-second pause,\nany new letter hit will be considered the start of a new word.\nNote that this will not work if you have hyperkeys turned on.\nMoving around using steno equivalents\nYou can type the first several letters of a steno stroke in order to jump directly to\nthe dictionary entry you're interested in without having to use the search or go to\nfunctions.\nThis feature does allow phonetic equivalents. As long as you type the letters with\nless than a second delay, it will assume that you intend them as a sequence. For\nexample, if you hit \"N\" it might jump to \"TPH- = in\", then hitting \"I\" will jump to\n\"TPHEU = any\", then hitting \"N\" again will jump to \"TPHEUPB = anyone\".\nNote that this will not work if you have hyperkeys turned on.\nVISUALIZERS:\nvM5_Auto-Magic_Dictionary.mp4\nvH1 Analyze Documents.mp4\nvH1_Build_Dictionary.mp4\nvH1_Dictionary_Selection.mp4\nvH1a_Change_Translating_Dictionaries.mp4\nvH6_Dictionary_Optimize.mp4\nVH3_Text-Sorted_Dictionaries.mp4\nvH6a_Arranging_Dictionary_Columns.mp4\nvH3_Dictionary_Additions_Spellcheck.mp4\nvH3_Dictionary_Edit.mp4\nvH3_Dictionary_Properties_Comments.mp4\nvH2_Dictionary_Searches.mp4\nvH2_Go_to_Steno.mp4\nvH2_Starts_Ends_Exact.mp4\n674 Eclipse Help\nvH2_Keys_v_Strokes.mp4\nvH2_Dictionary_Find_Replace.mp4\nvH2a_Dictionary_Advanced.mp4\nvH2b_Selecting_Dictionary_Entries.mp4\nvH2b_Move_Dictionary_Entries.mp4\nvH2b_Unmerge_Dictionaries.mp4\nvH4_Dictionary_Export.mp4\nvH5_Scopist_Dictionary.mp4\nvH5a_Merge_Scopist_Dictionary.mp4\nvH7_Dictionary_Statistics.mp4\nvH8_Dictionary_Printout.mp4\nvH9_Passport_Dictionary.mp4\nvP6c_Passport_Touch Dictionary.mp4\nWorking With... 675\n21.6 Dictionaries, Multiple\nWorking With MULTIPLE\nDICTIONARIES\nWhen you translate a job, one or more dictionaries will be used in the translation.\nYour Main dictionary is always used. In addition, you may use a Job dictionary and/or\none or more User dictionaries to further refine the translation.\nJob Dictionaries\nEach job you do will have a Job dictionary (unless you manually remove it from\nthe Dictionaries dialog ). The Job dictionary is a dictionary of entries relevant to\nthis job only, such as names and terms from the current case. The job dictionary will\nbe created one of two ways:\nÂ· By default, Eclipse will create a job dictionary when you begin the translation. The\njob dictionary will have the same name as the text file.\nÂ· You can set up a Master Job dictionary. To do this, go to the User tab of User\nSettings, click the Dictionaries button, and assign a dictionary to the Job slot on the\nDictionaries dialog .\nIt is useful to set up a Master Job dictionary when you have to produce a series of\nindividual transcripts that will all take the same job dictionary, such as an ongoing\ncase. Rather than re-create the Job dictionary entries each session, you can re-use the\njob dictionary you made on the first day by selecting it as Master Job.\nIf you designate a Master Job dictionary, Eclipse will not create the job dictionary\nthat has the same name as the transcript.\nWhether your Job dictionary is a Master Job or not, any globals made using\nCtrl+J will go into that dictionary.\nUser Dictionaries\nA User dictionary is another dictionary that can be used in addition to Main and\nJob. Typically, this slot is used for specialty dictionaries, such as a dictionary of terms\npertaining to medical malpractice, asbestos, family court, captioning, or whatever\ntype of work you do.\nThere are two advantages to using a User dictionary for these types of entries.\nFirst, not putting them into the main dictionary keeps the main dictionary efficient,\nand eliminates the possibility of writing these entries accidentally when you are\nreporting a different type of case. Second, this practice allows you to re-use briefs.\nYou can use the same steno to mean different things in different User dictionaries. As\nlong as you select your extra dictionaries correctly for each job, you are assured of the\ncorrect translation.\n955\n101\n955\n326\n676 Eclipse Help\nUser dictionaries are optional. Unlike the Main or Job, you do not have to use one,\nand Eclipse will not create one by default.\nTo create a User dictionary, create a new dictionary file , and assign it to a\nUser slot on the Dictionaries dialog .\nTo global into a User dictionary, press the Ctrl key plus the number of the\nUser dictionary. Ctrl+1 would place the global in the User 1 dictionary, Ctrl+2 would\nput it into User 2, etc.\nMaking Permanent Dictionary Selections\nThe scope of changes made on the Dictionaries dialog is dependent upon\nwhere you access it from. If you access it via the Dictionaries button on the User\ntab , your selections will be the default for all future jobs. This is the best way to\nselect a Master Job dictionary, since you generally want it to be in effect for multiple\njobs.\nIf you select extra dictionaries this way, you may want to uncheck Use In\nTranslation. If you do, the dictionaries will be pre-selected, but each time you begin a\ntranslation you can turn on just the ones you want to use for that job. This allows you\nto pre-select every extra dictionary you might ever use (as User dictionaries), and\nthen from the Translate Notes/Dictionaries dialog check Use In Translation only\nfor the ones you wish to use in today's transcript.\nIf you access the Dictionaries dialog from the Dictionaries button on the\nTranslate Notes dialog, the changes you make will be for that translation only.\n(Again, the default setup will be whatever you chose from the User tab.)\nIf you access it by pressing F9 when a (previously-translated) text file is\nopen, the changes you make will pertain to the dictionary assignments for that job.\nFor example, you could assign a new dictionary to place Job or User globals into,\neven if that dictionary was not used in the translation of the job.\nDictionary Priority\n1. Job (highest priority)\n2. User 1\n3. User 2\n4. User 3, etc., through User 8, in numerical order\n5. Main (lowest priority)\nThe priority only matters if the same steno appears in two or more of the\ndictionaries that are in use. If it does, the definition from the higher-priority dictionary\nwill be used.\nVISUALIZERS: H1 - Dictionary Selection\nH1a - Change Translating Dictionaries\n1036\n955\n326\n955\n101\n955\n269\n694\n326\nWorking With... 677\n21.7 File Manager\nWorking with File Manager\nCtrl+F\nOpens the Eclipse File Manager. You can perform almost any file-management\ntask from this dialog. If you prefer to use Windows Explorer for file management,\nsimply press Ctrl+F a second time, or click the Explore button on the File Manager.\nFile Locations\nThe tabs are a list of all your folder locations. Click a tab to go to that location.\nThe Job folder is listed first for convenience; the others appear alphabetically. Folders\nyou will have may include:\n678 Eclipse Help\n1. Jobs. Your Jobs folder, as defined in Advanced User Settings . This is where\nmost of your job files are stored.\n2. Blocks. Your Blocks folder, as defined in Advanced User Settings . This is\nwhere block files are stored. By default, the Jobs and Blocks folder are the same.\n3. Writer. The writer drive. Typically, this drive has the letter A: you can select a\ndifferent letter with the Read from option on the Input tab of User\nsettings.\n4. Aux. The Auxiliary drive, as defined in Advanced User Settings . If you are\ngoing to be moving files to out of your Jobs folder into a separate location (such as\nan external storage device, or an \"Old Jobs\" folder), it is useful to select this drive\nas your Aux drive. Again, do this from the User tab .\n5. Network. The Network drive, as defined in Advanced User Settings . Like Aux,\nthis is a folder you can designate.\n6. Backup. If you use the \"Backup to a separate directory on the hard drive\" choice in\nthe Backup feature, this tab will allow you to view the contents of that folder.\n7. Browse. Allows you to select a specific folder to work with. You can use this to\nbrowse to the Users folder, which gives you a quick way to delete, rename, or copy\nusers .\nNote that \"DESKTOP\" is one of the locations you can use. You can add\n{DESKTOP} in the File Locations feature, making it possible to create folders such as\nEXPORT={DESKTOP}scopist\\RTF files.\nFile Manager gives you tremendous flexibility for creating your own\norganizational structure. You can specify arbitrary file locations entirely of your own\ndesign and they will be available anywhere that files need to be accessed.\nFiles\nOnce you have selected a file location, the main pane of the window will show\nyou all files in that location. (If you have a job open, when you go into the file\nmanager it will move to the file you currently have open.)\nA \"job\" is a number of files that share the same name. Typically, these files will\nall relate to one particular transcript. For example, today's transcript may have a text\nfile, a dictionary, a raw steno file, and a WAV sound file.\nFile management tasks can be performed on an entire job, or to individual files\nwithin the job. The plus/minus sign at left indicates whether or not you are working\nwith an entire job, or an individual file. If it is a plus, that is a complete job; clicking\nthe plus (or pressing the right arrow key) will \"expand\" the job, and show you all\nindividual files in the job. A minus sign indicates an expanded job. In the above\ngraphic, the job named \"sample\" has been expanded.\nIf you have many subfiles in a job (jobname.ecl, jobname_01.ecl,\njobname_02.ecl, jobname_1.wav, jobname_2.wav, etc.) it is possible to have so\nmany subfiles that the list extends below the bottom of the file manager window. It\nmay even take several screens to go through them all. The file manager allows\nscrolling through the subfiles individually instead of always treating the whole group\nas a single point in the scrollbar tied to the master file.\n906\n906\n228 228\n108\n101\n108\n939\n108\nWorking With... 679\nWhether you are working with the entire job, or one or more component files,\nchecking the box at left will select that file for action. After selecting a job/file (or any\ncombination of files and jobs), any action you take will affect all selected jobs. You\nmay also select a job or file by pressing the space bar.\nCopying and Moving Files\nOnce you have selected one or more jobs, you may take any of the following\nactions on them. (This section will refer to \"jobs and/or files\" as simply \"files\" for\nbrevity, except where the difference matters.)\nCopy To will copy the files to the location specified in the drop-down list at top\ncenter. If you are frequently copying files to the same location, select that location\nfrom the drop-down list. It will remain selected; you need then only click the Copy\nTo button to send the files there. Alternatively, you may select Prompt For\nDestination, which will ask you to select the destination each time.\nThe Prompt for destination button is used with Copy to... and Move to..... It\nlists all your folder locations, beginning with the option to send via email or Burn to a\nCD.\n.\nÂ· E-mail. Will open an email message, with the files already attached. See Visualizer\non E-mail. 683\n680 Eclipse Help\nÂ· Burn to CD. If you are using Windows XP, you can burn files to a CD directly from\nthe Eclipse File Manager. If you are using a CD-RW, you will be asked if you want to\ndelete the existing files first. If you are using a CD that already has files on it, the\nnew files will simply be added to the CD. See Visualizer on Burning to CD.\nThe Move To button works just like Copy To, except that the file will be\nremoved from its current location. Copy To copies the file to its new location, but also\nleaves it where it is now.\nOther Actions\nRename will rename the file. If you have selected an entire job, all files within\nthe job will be renamed. (Some tasks, such as audio synchronization , require\nthe files to have the same name. Be careful when renaming individual files.)\nDelete will rename the file. If you delete a file by accident, it can be recovered\nfrom the Windows Recycle Bin, which is on your desktop. (See Windows Help for more\ninformation).\nZip will zip the file. Each job will have its own zip file. See the page on Working\nWith Zip Files for more detail.\nUnzip will unzip the file.\nBackup allows you to backup the selected file in an archived form, similar to\nusing the Backup feature. You will be asked to select a location to backup the file\nto.\nRestore restores a file that has been previously backed up.\nTranslate will translate a raw steno file, just as if you had done it from the\nTranslate Notes dialog.\nOpen will open the file. If you attempt to open a non-Eclipse file, such as an\nASCII or Bridge file, it will open in the program most appropriate for that file type.\nPrint will print the file.\nASCII will create an ASCII version of the file.\nRevert will revert to a previous version of the file. To use this feature, you must\nhave Timed Auto Backup turned on. With Timed auto-backup on, Eclipse will\ncreate a series of backup files, as frequently as you specify, named jobname.bk0,\njobname.bk1, jobname.bk2, etc. up to jobname.bk9. When you press the Revert\nbutton, it displays a list of all of the backup files for the current job. The one you\nselect will be copied over the Jobname.ecl in the jobs folder. Note that this does NOT\nsave the original Jobname.ecl file anywhere. You should NOT use Revert unless the\ncurrent version of the file is unsalvageable.\n683\n649\n639\n939\n269\n600\n622\n308\nWorking With... 681\nThe files are saved in the backup folder, which by default is \"\\Eclipse backups.\"\nYou can change the location of the backup folder in User\nsettings/Programming/File locations/BACKUP=. The .bk files are copies of the\n.ECL transcript file that can be reverted to in the event of a catastrophic error. This is\nwhat the Revert button does; it switches back to the previously saved version of the\njob, allowing you to switch to a version of the job that predates the error. The next\ntime you open the .ECL file, it will be the older, reverted-to version.\nHaving a series of backup files will allow you to go back to an even older version\nof the file if the most recent backup contains an error that you were trying to recover\nfrom (such as a disastrous block-delete or ill-advised text global.) If you have your\nbackup interval set to 30 minutes, for example, it will keep the last five hours worth\nof backups.\nThe Revert button will also work on dictionary and .ini files. If you highlight a\ndictionary or an .ini file and hit Revert, you will be presented with a list of the ten\nrotating backups automatically created for that file. Selecting one and restoring it will\nimmediately cause that dictionary or .ini file to be re-loaded.\nProperties button will display file data. This is the same information you get\nwhen you select Properties in Windows Explorer. Most of this information can be\nviewed in the Job Stats box .\nSearch opens a dialog where you can search for files. You may search by name,\ndate, size or any criteria that appears in the Job Stats box . The search can find\nsomething in any of the files listed, as long as it is a variable in a form field â for\nexample \"Case #123\", or \"Mr. Peterson\".\nFormat Disk will format a floppy disk. Follow the prompts you are given. If your\nfloppy drive is a letter other than A, select that letter from the Diskette Drive list\non the the Input tab .\nLive updating\nIf you delete or rename a file, a file, or it grows larger, etc., while the file\nmanager is open, (such as if you modify something in Windows explorer) it will\nupdate the list after a few seconds.\nNote that this capability is temporarily suspended if you are selecting multiple\nfiles or if you have multiple files expanded to see the sub-contents, since live\nupdating could move the contents around and disrupt the selection process.\nOther Options\nThe Job Statistics box at bottom left shows information about the selected job.\nYou can see the filename, size, number of pages, date created, date last edited, and a\nlist of extra dictionaries that were used in the creation of the job. Additional\ninformation includes a list of Speakers, statistics, and variables. Under variables,\nVoice users will see their Dragon profile name, listed as DRAGONPROFILE=Your Profile\nName.\nThe gear button at top center takes you to the User tab .\n681\n681\n228\n228\n101\n682 Eclipse Help\nThe Summary button will create a text file containing information about the\nfile(s) you have selected. After you click Summary, a file dialog will appear. The\ndefault name of the summary file will be JobSummary.txt, but you can name it\nanything you like. Click \"Open\" or press Enter to create the file. The resulting file is an\nASCII file that can be viewed in any program, or even cut-and-pasted into a\nEclipse text file .\nNormally a summary of pages in a transcript only provides information on the\nprimary document in that job. The file manager assumes that filename_01.ecl,\nfilename_02.ecl, etc., are partial files, such as division intervals, used by editors, and\nshould not be counted. Sometimes, those are segments of a job that should be\ncounted. If you wish to count them, make sure to hit the + sign icon next to the job\nname to expand the list of files. If the list is expanded, and the documents in\nquestion are checked, then they will be counted when you run the summary function.\nThe Settings button opens the Job Manager Options dialog, where the following\nchoices can be made:\nÂ· Excluded From Whole Job ZIP is a list of extensions that will be excluded\nfrom any ZIP file that is created from a whole job. It is a good idea to type \"WAV\"\nhere, to exclude WAV sound files from being included in a ZIP.\nÂ· Warning Level When Deleting controls how frequently you are warned when\ndeleting files. Your choices are Never, Once at Beginning, Each Job, or Each File.\nDeleted files can always be retrieved from the Windows Recycle Bin, regardless of\nyour choice here.\nÂ· Email Subject Default is the text that will initially appear in the subject line when\nyou use the Email button. You may set this to a custom message. You can also\nuse the {VARNAME} syntax in the e-mail subject line just as you can in the cover\npage and multi-page header/footer features in order to include the variable names\nfrom the document form fields such as case name, witness name, etc., in the e-mail\nsubject automatically for the delivery feature.\nÂ· Email Body Text is the text that will initially appear in the body of the email when\nyou use the Email button.\nThe Explore button will open Windows Explorer, if you would prefer to use that\nfor file management. To quickly open Windows Explorer from Eclipse, press Ctrl+F\ntwice.\nThe Exit button will close the File Manager.\nVISUALIZERS:\nJ1 - File Manager\nJ1 - File Manager Navigation\nJ1a - File Info\nJ1a - File Search\nJ1b - Auxiliary Folder\nJ1b - Copy/Move File\nJ1b - Destination Prompt\nJ1c - Delete/Recover File\n969\n393\n1062\n971\n679\n679\nWorking With... 683\nJ1c - Recycle Bin\nJ3 - Backup Work Files\nJ3b_BAK_Files\nJ1b - CD Burn\nJ1b - E-mail\nI1a_Delivery\n21.8 Hyperkeys\nWorking With HYPERKEYS\nHyperkeys offer you a faster way to edit transcripts.\nInstead of using arrow keys to move the cursor, and the Ctrl/Alt/function keys to\nperform editing actions, hyperkeys allow you to perform editing tasks by simply using\nthe letter keys. This allows you to keep your hands in one place, and saves you having\nto reach for Ctrl/Alt keys, thus speeding your editing time.\nA list of the default Hyperkeys is in the Reference Guide.\nOnly repetitive editing tasks have hyperkeys. There are no hyperkeys for nonrepetitive\ntasks like Open Text , User Settings , or Close . Just use the\nstandard keys for those actions. (Standard keystrokes will always work, even if you\nhave hyperkeys turned on.)\nWhen using hyperkeys, you will need to suspend them if you want to type text.\nThis is accomplished with the Type Text command (hyperkey N). When you need\nto type something, press the N key; that will temporarily suspend hyperkeys and\nallow you to type text as normal. When you are finished typing text, press Enter, and\nthe hyperkeys will be reactivated.\nThe hyperkeys command (Alt+Z), toggles them on and off. You can tell if\nhyperkeys are on by any of the following methods:\nÂ· The text HYP will appear in the status bar at bottom right.\nÂ· The Hyperkeys button on the toolbar will appear pushed-in.\nÂ· The cursor width will change. By default, a wide cursor means hyperkeys are on,\nand a thin cursor means they are off. This can be redefined with the Hyperkey\nWidth item on the Display tab of User Settings .\nThere are several places in the program where you can see a list of hyperkeys:\nÂ· If hyperkeys are turned on, the menu hints will show you the hyperkeys for each\naction.\nÂ· The AutoMagic infobar will show you the hyperkeys for each suggestion on the list.\n777\n86 99 945\n317\n315\n1058\n129 122\n684 Eclipse Help\nÂ· Each page in the help system gives the default hyperkey for that action, if there is\none.\nÂ· The Documentation folder (Support menu/Documentation) contains a file\ncalled \"Eclipse Hyperkeys.pdf\", which is a printable chart of hyperkeys.\nÂ· You can print a list of all key assignments , including hyperkeys, from the\nKeyboard dialog .\nTyping Over\nIf you use the Type Text command (hyperkey N) to suspend hyperkeys,\nyou can also use it to replace an existing word with the new word. To do this:\n1. With the cursor at the beginning of the word you want to replace, press hyperkey\nN.\n2. Type the new word.\n3. Press Enter. This is the normal step to return to hyperkey mode.\n4. Press Enter a second time. This will remove the old word.\nWhenever you do this, an entry is made in the typeover tracking list.\nVISUALIZERS:\nA7 - Hyperkeys\nM3 - AutoMagic Display\nM3a Auto-Magic Numbered Choices\n21.9 Number Conversion\nWorking With NUMBER\nCONVERSION\nRELATES TO: Numbers tab .\nEclipse's automatic number conversion feature allows you to write numbers as\nyou hear them, and have them automatically format correctly. However, it does\nrequire some setup.\nHere's how it works: any time you write a series of \"number words\", Eclipse will\nexamine them as a group, and produce a formatted number based on your\npreferences. You set your preferences on the Numbers tab .\nDictionary Entries\nFirst, you must put number words into your dictionary:\n31\n1010\n1008\n317\n884\n264\n264\nWorking With... 685\nÂ· 0 through 20, written out. (You do not need dictionary entries for number bar\nstrokes, unless they mean something other than the numbers themselves.)\nÂ· 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90.\nÂ· hundred, thousand, million, billion, etc.\nÂ· 21 through 99, but only if you write them as one-stroke entries: TWUPN for 21,\nTWAO for 22, TWAOE for 23, etc. If you write multi-stroke entries TWEPBT/WUPB,\nTWEPBT/TO, etc., no entry is needed.\nÂ· Either the word \"point\", or an entry defined as {DECIMAL} for a decimal point.\nÂ· Ordinals: first, second, third, etc., or a stroke that will convert a number to an\nordinal. You may make entries for {^st}, {^nd}, {^rd}, and {^th}, or a {#O}\nentry.\nÂ· Words for units of measure (feet, gallons); time (o'clock, a.m., p.m.); money\n(dollars), etc.\nOnce your dictionary has all the necessary entries, you must then remove any\nredundant entries. Redundant entries are entries that can be written with a\ncombination of existing entries. Redundant entries can cause problems with number\nconversion.\nThis is an example of a redundant entry:\nSEUBS HUPB = 600\nThis entry is redundant, because you have separate dictionary entries for:\nSEUBS = six\nHUPB = hundred\nEclipse will automatically combine the two entries to generate \"six hundred.\"\nIf you're getting results such as SEUBGS/HUPB/TWEPBT = \"600 twenty\", the\nproblem is most likely a redundant entry.\nPreferences\nOnce your dictionary is set up, you will then set your preferences on the\nNumbers tab .\nNumber Conversion Codes\nThe Numbers tab controls only general preferences. There are some instances\nwhere you will always want a number to be in digits, such as Exhibit numbers. To\naccomplish this, include number conversion codes in your dictionary entries.\n264\n686 Eclipse Help\nConversion codes can be written before, after, or even during the number series\nthey affect. They will change the appearance of the entire number series.\nHere is a list of the most commonly-used number conversion codes, and what\neach one does:\nCode What It Converts To Example Explanation\n{#G} Convert to generic digits. Exhibit{#\nG}\nEnsures that any number\nfollowing the word \"Exhibit\" will\nappear as digits.\nCan also be part of a conflict:\n\\exhibit\\Exhibit{#G}\n{#N} Convert an ordinal or dollar amount\nto its numeric form.\n{#N} of\nApril\nEnsures that any ordinal\npreceding the word \"April\" will\nappear in its numeric form, e.g.\n\"3rd of April\".\n{#T} Convert to time. {#T}\nIf you write SEUBGS/THEURT/\n{#T}, you will get 6:30.\nIs typically a stand-alone entry.\n{#D} Convert to a date. {#D}\nIf you write SEUBGS/THEURT/\n{#T}, you will get 6/30.\nIs typically a stand-alone entry.\n{#M} Convert to money. {#M}\nIf the deponent says \"fifty\" in\nresponse to a question about a\ndollar amount, you can write 50/\n{#M} and it will be formatted as\na dollar amount.\n{#O} Convert to ordinal. {#O}\nYou can create an ordinal by\nwriting an ordinary number, and\nwriting {#O} adjacent to it.\nOther number conversion codes:\nCode Converts To...\n{#W} written out\n{#R} Roman numerals **\n{#r} Roman numerals, lower case\n{#C} money subunit (cents)\n{#Q} quantity\n{#P} Phone number\n{#1} through {#9} User-defined format 268 .\nWorking With... 687\n** The Number converter can auto-detect and reverse-convert roman numerals\nback to digits. Note that this feature works with both the number conversion\ncommand and with the AutoMagic suggestions.\nVISUALIZERS:\nG1 - Numbers Overview\nG1a - Number Settings\nM12 - Auto-Magic Numbers\n21.10 Punctuation\nWorking With\nPUNCTUATION\nThis topic covers inserting, changing, and translating punctuation.\nInserting/Editing Punctuation\nTo insert a punctuation mark in a text file , press the key for the desired mark.\nThe punctuation will be inserted to the left of the current word. Spacing and\ncapitalization will be adjusted as needed.\nFor example, if you have this sentence:\nPressing the period key on the keyboard, while the cursor is on the beginning of\nthe word \"now\", would produce:\nYou can change this to a different punctuation mark, simply by pressing the key\nyou wish to change to. Spacing and capitalization will again be adjusted, if necessary:\nNote that punctuation editing is done with the cursor on the beginning of the\nfollowing word. This allows you to do the entire punctuation edit in one keystroke,\ninstead of having to manually space, capitalize, etc. each time.\n694\n688 Eclipse Help\nTo remove a punctuation mark, press the Backspace key. If you use the\nBackspace key to remove a punctuation mark, you can do so from the beginning of\nthe following word, and for any punctuation defined in the metadictionary, it will\nremove any associated case changes, spaces, etc. For example, in a piece of text such\nas âHe. Went homeâ you can place the cursor on the âWâ and hit the backspace key\nto remove the period, the extra space and down-case the âW.â\nIf the cursor is not at the beginning of a word, pressing a punctuation key will\nsimply insert the mark at that point. This can be useful in situations where you need\nto insert a punctuation mark into the middle of a word (for websites, or a name with\ninitials), or put multiple punctuation marks next to each other (for phrases such as \"it\nwas six a.m., I believe.\") Note that Jump Punctuation Left will have to be\nunchecked, as this command will make all punctuation inserts behave as if the cursor\nis on the beginning of the word.\nIf you type a punctuation command which does not have a cap command in its\nmetadictionary entry, when that punctuation is typed before a capped word or is used\nto replace a terminal punctuation mark such as a period, the word will be downcapped\nif the lower-case version is correctly spelled.\nOther Punctuation Commands\nÂ· You can insert/change terminal punctuation to a period, question mark, or\ndash .\nÂ· The following commands will place the punctuation mark at the end of the\nsentence, replacing any other terminal punctuation mark:\nTo place a Period: Alt+P\nTo place a Question mark: Alt+Q\nTo place a Double dash (- -): Alt+D\nChanges to the behavior of these and other punctuation commands can be done\nusing the Metadictionary. WARNING: If you are an inexperienced user, you should not\nattempt to edit your metadictionary without expert guidance.\nBy default, the period, question mark, and double dash will be followed by two\nspaces. If you want to change that to one space, for example if you are exporting the\ndocument to be published in a proportional font, you can change the\nMetadictionary entries. In User settings/Programming/Metadictionary, select\nthe entry, {.} for example. and change the \"Force right boundary text\" from two\nspaces to one.\nAnother default behavior controls capitalization after a colon. The default\nbehavior inserts a space after the colon, and the next word will be capitalized. If you\ndo not insert a space, the next word will be lower case. So if you are using the colon\nbefore a list of items, for example, do not insert a space.\n307\n357\n805\nWorking With... 689\nSimilarly, if you do not want a lockspace before a double dash, you can edit the\nMetadictionary entry, removing the lockspace. You would simply change the entry\nfrom\n{--}={/<^[,;?~]~/\"[-][]--/?DPC} to\n{--}={/<^[,;?~]/\"[-][]--/?DPC}\nÂ· You can use block marking to perform some quick punctuation edits, such as\nsurrounding a phrase with commas or quotation marks, or hyphenating a multiword\nphrase.\nÂ· Toggle apostrophe .\nÂ· If the metadictionary entry for a particular punctuation mark doesn't have a cap\ncommand in it, then when that punctuation is typed before a capped word or is\nused to replace a terminal punctuation mark such as a period, the word will be\ndown-capped if the lower-case version is correctly spelled.\nApostrophes\nTo convert a word to its possessive form, place the cursor in the word and press\nAlt+A. This is a 3-way toggle. The first Alt+A will add 's. If the word ends in s, the\nfirst Alt+A will make it into 's. The second Alt+A will change it to s' and the third will\nremove the apostrophe altogether. If the word is already in possessive form, this\ncommand will open a menu. (See discussion below)\nYou can also use the Edit menu/Miscellaneous/Flip apostrophe command.\nFlip apostrophe (Alt+A) and contractions\nFor words ending in \"s,\" hitting Alt+A will cycle from s to s', then 's, then s'\nagain. Because 's can either be a possessive or a contraction of \"is\" or \"has,\" the\nsecond time cycling through Alt+A will bring up an alternates menu similar to the\nillustration below, based on \"doctor's.\" It will include xxxxs's in the cycle for items\nsuch as \"Jones's\" and \"witness's.\"\n395\n357\n690 Eclipse Help\nAny common contraction can be toggled to its expanded form by putting the\ncursor on it and hitting Alt+A.\nFor example: don't --> do not\nNote that the cursor will be left on the \"n\" in \"not\" when you do this. That's\nbecause any two-word phrase that can be contracted can be converted to its\ncontraction by putting the cursor on the second or contracted word. For example: he\nwill --> he'll (the cursor must be on the \"w\" in \"will\").\nBecause some contractions could be several forms of phrases (\"where'd he go\nyesterday\" \"where'd you like to go tomorrow\" \"she'd have to go\" \"she'd better go\"),\nwhen hitting Alt+A on a word ending in 'd you will get a menu containing\ned/had/would/did so that you can select which one it should be. You can select the\ncorrect choice by highlighting and hitting Enter or clicking OK, or by typing the\nnumber of the choice.\nWorking With... 691\nThe Alt+A contractions feature gives two options when executed on a word\nending in \"ing.\" It will bring up a menu to change it to in' or to add 's as this feature\ndoes with most words.\nUnconventional spellings are included in the list of possible choices for some\nwords. For example, if you try to contract \"should have\" you will get a menu\ncontaining \"should've\" or \"shoulda.\"\nCustom contractions\nMany contractions are fairly basic and easily customized. You can use the default\nlist in the User settings/Programming tab \"Contractions\" list, remove any you\ndon't want, and add your own.\nThe default list is:\nÂ· am+not=ain't\nÂ· shall+not=shan't\nÂ· will+not=won't\nÂ· I+am=I'm\nÂ· it+was='twas\nÂ· let+us=let's\nÂ· going+to=gonna\nÂ· got+to=gotta\nÂ· want+to=wanna\nYou can use this feature both for contractions, and for any common error in which\none word becomes two or two words become one.\n826\n692 Eclipse Help\nReverse ? and /\nMost reporters need to type a question mark more often than they do the slash,\nso many prefer to switch the slash and question mark keys. That way they don't have\nto use the Shift and slash key to get a question mark.\nTo set your keyboard to use the slash for the question mark (and Shift / to enter\na slash) go to User settings/Edit tab , and mark the checkbox for Reverse ? and /\n.\nJump punctuation left\nYou can easily change a paragraph from one format to another, or insert (start) a\nnew paragraph. Notice that, along the left side of the document window, a lettered\nbutton appears adjacent to each paragraph. The letter on the button indicates the\nparagraph's format (e.g. Q=Question paragraph). Clicking a paragraph button opens\nthe Paragraph Data dialog, which you can use to assign a different format to the\nparagraph or to change characteristics of that single paragraph.\nNote that if the top of the screen is the middle of a paragraph, the paragraph\nbutton in the margin will still appear to let you know what sort of paragraph it is (and\nto allow you to change it, if desired.)\nDictionary Entries\nIn general, dictionary entries for punctuation marks should be in braces:\nSyntax Mark\n{.} period\n{,} comma\n{?} question mark\n{;} semi-colon\n{:} colon\nFor more advanced punctuation entries, see the page on dictionary entry\nsyntax .\nAutomatic Punctuation\nThe following punctuation marks apply automatically to the previous word:\ncomma, period, question mark, colon, semicolon, dash, hyphen, double-quote and\nsingle quote. The double and single quotes cycle between applying to the current\nword (begin quote) and the previous word (end quote).\nIf you do not write a punctuation mark at the end of a paragraph, Eclipse will\nautomatically insert an appropriate punctuation mark for the type of paragraph it is.\nThe mark you will get is determined by the Behaves As setting, on the Advanced\nParagraph Data settings from the Paragraphs tab.\n306\n958\n457\nWorking With... 693\nNote that choosing to turn off Auto capitalization in User settings/Edit tab\nonly tells Eclipse not to capitalize a word just because your cursor passes over it. It\ndoes not interfere with the Automatic punctuation's effect on capitalization.\nTyping a dash will not remove a period after an abbreviation\nThis goes for all punctuation, including commas and semicolons. The software\nlooks at the previous word and looks it up in the metadictionary. If that word is\nregistered as a title, the period will not be removed. Note that you can customize the\nmetadictionary to add additional titles beyond Mr., Mrs., Dr., Sgt., etc.\nSoft commas in Automatic Punctuation\nIf an entry ends in a soft comma and the next thing you write is a paragraph\nentry, the automatic punctuation for that paragraph entry will erase the comma\nbefore applying to the paragraph. For example, you can write a single entry\n{,?}okay{,?}\nand it will work in all of the following situations, where none of the following\ncommas was written by the reporter:\nÂ· Q. State your name.\nÂ· A. Well, okay, it's John.\nÂ· Q. Okay, and what's your last name?\nÂ· A. Do I have to tell you?\nÂ· Q. Yes you do, okay?\nÂ· A. Okay.\nÂ· Q. So what is it?\nVISUALIZERS:\nvE6_Dashes_Hyphens.mp4\nvM11_Auto-Magic_Punctuation.mp4\n21.11 Saving\nWorking With SAVING\nRELATES TO: Close .\nThere is no explicit \"save\" command for files, because Eclipse\nautomatically saves your work as you go. Closing a text file, note file, or\ndictionary will save it.\n945\n694 Eclipse Help\nWhen you are editing, Eclipse keeps a log of every change you make,\nand enters in a hidden file called jobname.elg. It updates this file every 5\nseconds, so if there is a power failure, crash or lockup on your computer, you\nwill never lose more than 5 seconds' work. If there has been an unplanned\nshutdown, when you open the job and there's an elg file present, the\nsoftware knows that there are unsaved changes and immediately applies the\ncontents of the .elg file to the document transparently, restoring your most\nrecent edits.\nIf you would like additional protection, you can activate the Timed Auto\nBackup feature on the Edit tab of User Settings . It will do a\ncomplete save according to the auto-backup interval, which you can set for\nbetween 10 and 30 minutes. When it saves the file, it saves it simultaneously\nin jobname.ecl and jobname.ub0 in the backup folder, and deletes the\njobname.elg file, which is re-created when you have been editing for 5\nseconds.\n21.12 Text Files\nWorking With...\nTEXT FILES\nRELATES TO: Open Text , Block Files .\nA text file can be a transcript, block file , or list file .

It includes everything\non all ten tabs of User Settings , as well as the choices you've made in specific\ndialogs.\nIt can be advantageous to have multiple users for yourself. For example, if you\nwork in three different environments that have three different looks for their\ndocuments, you can create a user for each. When you go to work, you need only\nselect your user for today's client; the correct page formatting for that client will\nautomatically be used.\nScope of Users\nAny time you make a change in User Settings, it applies to that user only. This\nallows you to use different paragraph/document settings, different dictionaries,\ndifferent display settings, different translation options in any combination.\nCreating A New User\nIf you want to create a new user for yourself, do not use the Create New User\nbutton on the User tab . Instead, click Save Settings, and give the user a\ndifferent name. This will create a copy of your existing user; this means the new user\nwill have your main dictionary, folders, and other options. You may then work with\neach user independently.\nA user refers to a person, and not a group of settings; so once you have created\na user for yourself you probably wonât ever need to create a new user. However, if you\ndo need a new user (perhaps so someone else can use your computer and have his or\nher own settings files), then use User Settings/User tab/Create New User. This\nbutton starts the New User Setup Wizard, which walks you through the process.\nThe wizard creates a new user file, a new (empty) main dictionary, and a folder for\nstoring job-related files.\nWhen you click the Create new user button, a warning message will remind you\nto use this only for a whole new user.\n101\n99\n101\n696 Eclipse Help\nThe wizard will prompt you to enter identifying information and select a\nnickname. Note that while the wizard asks for a first and last name, you can enter any\ntwo words to identify the user, such as âJohn Smithâ When you click the Finish\nbutton on the wizard window, the new user settings file, dictionary, and file folder are\ncreated, each having the nickname you selected in the wizard (for example, if the\nnickname used for âJohn Smithâ were âJS,â the folder would be named JS, the\ndictionary would be JS.dix, and the settings file would be JS.ini). The folder created is\nthe default folder for storing jobs and blocks and also contains the new dictionary. The\ndictionary is an empty file into which you can import another dictionary, if desired, or\nbuild from scratch. The new userâs settings file (the â.iniâ file) has Eclipseâs default\nsettings.\nOnce the new user is successfully created, it becomes the current user. To\nswitch to a different user, go to User settings (Alt+U) and load a different user\nsettings file.\nSave Settings\nWhen you change settings in the User settings dialog, you can immediately\nsave the altered settings by clicking the Save button. This opens a dialog, in which\nthe current user settings file is listed in the Enter a filename field.\nIf you want to save these settings to that file, press Enter (or click OK).\nIf you want to save these settings to a new file, type a file name in the space\nand press Enter. This new user file is saved as an .ini file and becomes the active\none.\nIf you make a mistake in your user settings and you haven't saved them yet,\nyou can go to User settings/User/Advanced and hit the Revert settings button,\nwhich will reload your last .ini file without saving the changes.\nTo organize users, you can use underscores to group users. If have a Court.ini,\nyou can also create Court_County, Court_State, and Court_Federal and Eclipse allows\nyou to collapse and expand this list of users.\nWorking With... 697\nYou can set up any number of unique format types to accommodate different\ntypes of work in which you may be involved (i.e., different settings for different firms\nwith whom you work or for federal, state or other court requirements, CART, or other\ntypes of applications). You can save time by saving each group of settings in a user\nsettings file. This file contains information about job file locations, hardware (e.g.,\nyour writer) descriptions, translation rules, paragraph formats, document appearance,\nediting preferences (including customized prefixes and suffixes), and much more.\nBefore you start a new job in Eclipse, you can select which of the user settings files to\nuse, and save yourself the time of creating all those individual formats and\nrequirements for each job. (You might want to think of the settings file as being\nsomething like a template that you can apply to different files.)\nUser.ini Consolidation Naming Option\nEclipse 11 introduces the ability to organize your ini files into groups, based on\nsimple and familiar naming conventions.\nYou will need one user.ini file with the âorganizationâ name you want to use.\nOther user.ini files can use the âorganizationâ name followed by an underscore ( _ )\nand a unique designator for that specific ini.\n698 Eclipse Help\nThe load settings window showing consolidated users and the corresponding users in Windows.\nVISUALIZERS:\nB1_Load_Settings.mp4\nC5 - Save Settings vs. Create New User Format\nB1a - How to Undo Changes to User Settings (if not yet saved)\nC6 - How to Delete a User Format\nJ3a - SET files\nReference Guide 699\n22 Reference Guide\nReference Guide\nTopics here appear alphabetically, and provide a guide to advanced\nfeatures in more detail.\nMany of these topics are introduced in the Quick Start Guide and/or\nare covered in \"Working with...\" pages.

This is the same\ndata format used in file types such as .WAV files used in Microsoft Windows.\nSince PCM is an uncompressed format, audio files will tend to be very\nlarge, roughly 40 Megabytes per hour of recorded audio. Due to the size of\nthese files they can be difficult to manage and transfer from computer to\ncomputer. Beginning with Version 10, we recommend Opus, which records at\n25 Mb per hour.\nAudio compression really consists of two parts. The first part, called\nencoding, transforms the digital audio data that resides, say, in a WAVE file,\ninto a highly compressed form called bitstream (or coded audio data). To\nplay the bitstream on your soundcard, you need the second part, called\ndecoding. Decoding takes the bitstream and reconstructs it to waveform data\nsuitable for output.\nAudio Compression can be one of two categories, lossless or lossy.\nLossless compression algorithms produce audio data that is identical to the\noriginal audio information. Lossless compression sounds wonderful, however\nit does not yield an extremely high compression ratio. Typically, lossless\nroutines give a ratio no higher than 2:1 for real-time playback for audio with\na full dynamic range.\n42\n649\n700 Eclipse Help\nLossy Audio Compression can yield a variety of different rates of\ncompression based on the ability of your hardware and software to decode\nand playback the audio data in real-time. There are various compression\nschemes to achieve different results; for example, many codecs remove\nportions of the audio signal that human hearing is less sensitive to. To some\npeoples' ears, the resulting audio has distinguishing artifacts or\ncharacteristics that change the listening experience. The final âqualityâ level\nis largely a matter of personal perception.\nEach different compressor/decompresser (codec) has different\nstrengths and weaknesses. Typically, compression takes a good amount of\nprocessing power and decompressing must be real time or faster -- able to\ndecode and play simultaneously -- to be useful for an âon demandâ digital\naudio playback system.\nBelow you will find a list of the common codecs and some general\ninformation on their use in the current Windows operating systems. However,\nthe best method for finding a good codec to record audio is to try them\nyourself and determine what suits your listening needs.\nCommon Audio Codecs in Windows\nOpus compresses extremely high quality 48000hz, 16-bit audio, which\nwould normally be about 350mb per hour, down to about 25mb per hour with\nvirtually no audible quality loss. Opus is completely incompatible with .wav\nfiles, which equates to some compatibility issues with other software. Eclipse\ncan play back jobname.opus files recorded on Case Catalyst or the Luminex\nII writer. Opus files recorded in Eclipse work on Stenograph products, as\nwell. No conversion necessary.\nNote that an opus recording will create an .opus file, not a .wav file. It's\nan entirely different file format not just a different compression mechanism.\nThe speed controls and volume threshold features work fine with the Opus\ncodec since Eclipse extracts the data and processes it as raw waveform data\nbefore sending it to the playback device. Due to its small size and high\nquality, it makes an excellent solution for Team Editing and speech\nrecognition applications including Boost since both require sending audio\nthrough cloud-based services. It has been tested with IBM Watson and\nGoogle Speech API.\nOne caution: Opus files cannot be appended, so if you need to stop\nrecording, and then resume it, you have to use Pause. If you Stop the\nrecording, you will get a warning message that audio will not record. If you\nPause it, you can resume recording upon hitting the next stroke.\nReference Guide 701\nOpus files cannot have their internal data changed on-the-fly easily,\nand re-writing an entire file just to remove three seconds in the middle would\nbe an onerous process to wait through, so redaction will continue to use .wav\nfiles. If you are using Opus to record and you redact, you will get a\njobname_redacted.wav file, not a _redacted.opus file, and it will be PCM\n16000hz, 16-bit in order to most closely match the quality of the Opus file.\nRedactions will be performed on that file. Given the quality of opus files, it\nmakes more sense for converted files to use that than .wav format of any\ntype, so conversions of .mp3 or .m4a files will now convert to .opus (note\nthat .m4a files also now automatically convert in order to make using Zoom\nrecordings easier to import.)\nPCM - the standard Windows format for non-compressed audio files.\nResults in rather large files due to the uncompressed file format.\nMicrosoft ADPCM - Compressed WAV format. ADPCM (Adaptive\nDifferential Pulse Code Modulation) is an audio compression scheme which\ncompresses from 16-bit to 4- bit for a 4:1 compression ratio.\nGSM - Compressed WAV format. Good for recording human speech.\n(Used by many reporters) Microsoft G.723.1 - Used for computer telephony.\nGood for recording human speech. IMA ADPCM - This particular algorithm\nwas suggested by the International Multimedia Association (IMA). IMA\nADPCM compresses data recorded at various sampling rates. Sound is\nencoded as a succession of 4-bit or 3-bit data packets. Each data packet\nrepresents the difference between the current sampled signal value and the\nprevious value. The compression ratio obtained is relatively modest. As an\nexample: 16-bit data samples encoded as 4-bit differences result in 4:1\ncompression format. IMA ADPCM is directly supported on most Windows\nimplementations as a native format. Although the quality of IMA ADPCM\nvoice files is not great, the files are portable. There is a real advantage in\nhaving compact files that can be played on most Windows PCs. Windows\nsupports IMA ADPCM â.wavâ files in 4-bit format only and at sample rates\nbetween 8 and 41KHz.\nMP3 (MPEG I-audio layer 3 compression) -- In 1987, the Fraunhofer\nIIS-A started to work on perceptual audio coding. In a joint cooperation with\nthe University of Erlangen, the Fraunhofer IIS-A finally devised a very\npowerful algorithm that is standardized as ISO-MPEG Audio Layer-3. With the\nproper codecs, compression rates of up to 24 times can be achieved with\nnear- (but not) CD-quality. The beauty of MP3 is it's size vs. perceived\nquality, also its ability to be downloaded and then loaded into the flash\nmemory of MP3 players. It can also be streamed to MP3 client software and\nrecognized by most Web browser audio helper applications. Files are encoded\nat certain bit-rates for target download speeds; for example, very good\nquality can be attained with 160 kbps encoding. While there is a version of\nthe MP3 codec installed with Windows, it is only a trimmed down version of\nthe full blown codec that was produced, patented and licensed by Fraunhofer\nIIS-A.\nEach codec or format has 3 defining attributes that affect the quality of\naudio that is recorded and played back. These attributes are the Sample\nRate, Sample Size, and âChannelsâ, such as Mono (1) or Stereo (2)\nrecording.\n702 Eclipse Help\nThe sample rate is how many times per second the source material is\nbeing âsampledâ or recorded. Samples, like frequency, are measured in Hertz\n(Hz) or more precisely kilohertz (kHz). Sample rate affects the frequency\nresponse of the final recording. In general, the higher the sample rate, the\nbetter the sound quality. But, the best sample rate to use will depend on\nyour audio hardware, your application, and the amount of storage available\n(the higher the sample rate, the more hard disk space required). CDs use a\n44.1 kHz sample rate. This is considered âCD Qualityâ. Radio Quality is at 22\nkHz and telephone quality is at 11 kHz. Generally, voice or conference\nrecordings do not require such a high sampling rate, so using radio or\ntelephone quality should be sufficient to produce good audio for transcription.\nThe 44.1 kHz in a CD Quality recording means that you have 44.100\nvalues per second coming in from your sound card (or input file).\nThe sample size, or bit depth, is the amount of data, in bits, stored per\nsample. With the PCM format at telephone quality (11,025 kHz, 8-bit, Mono),\neach sample of data recorded is 8 bits (8 bits = 1 byte).\nThe third attribute is the number of channels; either Mono (1) or Stereo\n(2). Mono recordings should be sufficient for conference style recordings.\nChoosing stereo will record both left and right channels in the resulting .wav\nfile, effectively doubling your file size. This can be done using a microphone\nsplitter for 2 microphone, 2-channel recordings.\nFrom these attributes we can determine how large an audio file will be\nin a fixed amount of time. Here is the formula:\n[ Sample Rate * Channels * Sample Size * 3600 / 8 =\nBytes/Hour ]\nFor instance, if we record for 1-hour of audio at telephone quality, we\nmultiply the sample rate by the number of channels being recorded by the\nsample size then multiply the product by 3600 (number of seconds per hour)\nthen divide by 8 (number of bits per byte). e.g. 11025 * 1 * 8 * 3600 / 8 =\n39690000 bytes/hour or 39.7 Mb/Hr.\nNow that we have done the math, defined some audio formats and their\nattributes, we'll continue on to the Windows configuration and testing\nphases.\nThe Windows Sound and Multimedia System\nIn Windows Control Panel there are options for adjusting your sound\nsettings. âSounds and Audio Devicesâ is the Windows Control Panel\ncomponent for audio recording and playback adjustment.\nReference Guide 703\nMany computers with specialized audio hardware will also have a\nseparate Control Panel component used to fine tune the settings of it's DSP\n(Digital Signal Processor), speaker layout, microphone levels and whatever\nother options they can pack into their applets. Since we cannot document\nhere all possible audio hardware and their accompanying applets, it's up to\nyou to know your computer's hardware and to determine if there are\nadditional settings accessible via Control Panel applet or a program to\nconfigure your particular sound device. In general, the options we are most\nconcerned with will be available in the Sounds and Audio Devices applet.\nYou can access the Sound controls for your computer by going to User\nsettings/Realtime/Audio recording and clicking Levels. This will open\nthe Windows Sound menu.\nThe Volume Control Panel\nThe Volume Control Panel will be different from computer to computer\ndepending on the audio hardware that is being used on the system, and the\nversion of Windows you are running. There may be only one control on the\npanel or several controls side by side, which is generally the case.\nTo open the Volume Controls, go to Start/Settings/System/Sound.\nFrom there you can choose your output and input devices, and control the\nMaster volume level. Advanced options are at the bottom of the dialog.\nIf you look to the left of the Time on your taskbar, you should see a\nsmall icon that looks like a loud speaker. If you hover your mouse pointer\nover it, it should be labeled Volume. If you single-left-click the Volume icon,\na single volume control will be displayed. This is usually the main or âmasterâ\ncontrol for all audio playback settings. Increasing or decreasing it will\nincrease or decrease the volume of the audio source to your other devices.\nClicking away from the single volume control will close it automatically.\nRight-clicking on the Volume icon in the system tray offers a choice of\nopening the Volume mixer or the Sound settings dialog. All of the playback\ncontrols have a Mute option that can be selected to mute the individual\nplayback option. Make sure that Mute is not enabled on the Wave control.\nAlso make sure that Mute All is not enabled on the master Volume control if\navailable. If Line In is one of the controls you have listed in the Volume\nControl Panel, make sure that it IS muted. Microphones should not be listed\nin the Volume Control Panel. If it is, it must be muted or feedback may\noccur. The best option here would be to Mute the microphone then remove\nthe control from the Volume Control Panel. You'll see how to do this in the\nVolume Control properties.\n704 Eclipse Help\nThere is an Options menu on the menu bar of the Volume Controls.\nThere will be 3 options available in this menu â Properties, Advanced\nControls and Exit. Click the Options menu and see that Advanced Controls is\nselected, with a check mark next to it. If you do not see a check mark next to\nAdvanced Controls, left-click it once to enable these controls. When the\nAdvanced Controls are enabled, an Advanced button will appear on one or\nmore of the playback controls. On my computer, with Advanced Controls\nenabled, I have an advanced button under my control labeled Volume\nControl, my Master Volume control. Clicking the Advanced button will display\nthe Advanced Controls for Volume Control settings. There are 2 sections in\nmy Advanced Volume control page â Tone Controls and Other Controls. In\nthe Tone Controls section I can adjust the bass and treble tones of my audio\nplayback if necessary. generally a setting in the middle for both is sufficient.\nSome audio hardware may not allow you to make adjustments here, and\nnormally you won't need to. The Other Controls section has options\nspecifically for SPDIF audio connections with my computer and other SPDIF\ncapable devices. This section may have totally different settings available to\nyou, depending on your audio hardware. In general, you shouldn't need to\nmake any changes here. Click the Close button to exit the Advanced Controls\nfor Volume Control window.\nThe Properties option in the Options menu will allow us to select the\naudio Mixer device, if this is a choice. There is a section called âAdjust\nvolume forâ with 2 or 3 options available. They are Playback, Recording and\nOther. We will focus on Playback and Recording only.\nBy default, when opening the Volume Control properties, the âAdjust\nvolume forâ section has Playback selected. This selection will determine two\nthings: the Control Panel we view and what controls are available in that\nControl Panel as selected in the âShow the following volume controlsâ section.\nBy selecting or de-selecting any of the available controls from the âShow the\nfollowing volume controlsâ list, you add or remove that item's controller to or\nfrom the Volume Control Panel. This is where you would de-select your\nmuted microphone had it been listed on the Volume Control Panel. Making a\nchange will not take affect until you click the Ok button. Click Ok to close the\nVolume Control properties now.\nRecording options\nOpen the Recording tab on the Sound properties page. Generally you\nwill see CD Player, Microphone, Line In and maybe a sound mixer if you audio\nhardware is equipped with this capability. We will focus mainly on the\nmicrophone, since this is the input device we intend to record audio with.\nThe Microphone Control\nReference Guide 705\nWith the Microphone highlighted, click the Properties button to open\nthe Microphone properties dialog, which includes a Levels tab, where you can\nadjust the volume of the microphone. The Listen tab includes Power\nmanagement - be sure you have it set to \"Continue using when on battery\npower.\" Clicking the Configure button opens a dialog to \"Configure your\nSpeech Recognition experience.\" The Communications tab is used to adjust\nthe volume of different sounds when you are using your PC to place or\nreceive phone calls.\nIn the Levels controls for Microphone there is a microphone boost option\nor +db Gain option to amplify the audio input from the microphone. This can\nbe enabled or disabled. As a general rule, if you are using an external\namplified microphone, the boost or +db gain option should be disabled, since\nit already amplifies the sound it receives significantly. If you are using a nonamplified\nexternal microphone or a computer's internal microphone, you\nprobably want the boost or +db gain enabled. Make the appropriate selection\nfor your microphone type. We do not recommend the use of internal\nmicrophones for audio recording due to generally poor quality input and\nplacement on the computer, which is usually toward the reporter looking at\nthe computer screen.\nSome computers may have an Alternate Microphone option or Second\nMicrophone option available in the Other Controls section. If you have these\noptions, I recommend leaving them alone or getting more information on\nthat particular option from the computer's manufacturer on how the options\naffect audio recording. While I have seen these options on some computers, I\nhave no information on what they do or how they affect audio recording.\nClick the OK button to close the Microphone properties and return to the\nSound Control Panel.\nTesting your Audio Recording and Playback\nWhen attempting to record audio, the first thing you need to be sure of\nis that you have a working microphone. It does not matter if itâs an external\nmicrophone plugged into the proper jack on the computer or an internal\nmicrophone, although for transcription purposes we highly recommend an\nexternal amplified microphone. If you are using an amplified microphone, be\nsure that the battery is relatively fresh.\nIt also makes testing easier if you have both the Volume and Recording\nControl Panels open while testing your audio recording. You should open\nthese 2 Control Panels now if they are not already open.\nUsing Windows Voice/Sound Recorder to test Recording\nCapability\nWindows Voice (or Sound) Recorder can be used to test your\nmicrophone. Make sure that your microphone is connected to the computer\nand switched âOnâ, if applicable. Click the Record button on the Recorder\nwindow and read the following text aloud;\n706 Eclipse Help\nâThis is a test. We are recording audio with the PCM format at 8,000\nkilohertz, 8-bit, mono. End of test.â\nClick the Stop button to stop the audio recording. You should have\nnoticed the level graph in the center of the Sound Recorder window expand\nwhile you were speaking, if your equipment is connected and working\nproperly. Click the center Play button to playback your audio recording.\nIf you hear the audio playing, great! Your hardware and computer are\ncapable of recording audio. You may want or need to adjust your playback\nand recording levels, but your hardware and computer are recording at this\npoint. You should be ready to start testing the different audio codecs to see\nwhat will give you the best quality-to- compression ratio for your audio\nrecordings. You can skip the next section, Audio Troubleshooting and start\nthe Working with Audio Codecs section.\nAudio troubleshooting\nIf you didn't hear any audio playback, here is a list of things to check:\nÂ· Make sure the Wave control is not muted and is at at least 50%\nintensity. Make sure the Volume control is not muted and is at at least\n50% intensity.\nÂ· Make sure your microphone is connected to the microphone input jack\non your computer. (Not Line In or the Headphones audio jacks.)\nÂ· Make sure your microphone has a fresh battery, if applicable.\nÂ· Look for a manual volume control on your computer that needs\nadjustment. Increase the microphone recording level.\nÂ· Enable microphone boost or +db gain in Microphone/Advanced Options.\nTest the microphone on a different computer or audio system if possible,\nto be sure it works properly.\nÂ· Try a different microphone if possible.\nWe recommend only making one of these changes at a time, then\nreplaying or re- recording and replaying the audio each time to get your\ndesired audio recording and playback levels. To re-record your audio, click\nthe File menu, choose New from the list and click No when prompted to save\nthe current audio file. This will clear the current audio buffer and allow you to\nstart a new recording.\nIf you have tried all of the options listed above and still have no audio\nplayback and there is no noticeable fluctuation in the center of the Sound\nRecorder window while you are recording audio, you should probably seek\noutside assistance from the computer's manufacturer or a trusted local\ncomputer shop to determine why the computer is not able to record and\nplayback audio.\nReference Guide 707\nTesting compression settings\nIn User settings/Realtime tab, select Compression in the Audio\nrecording dialog under WAV audio recording settings. Then, open a blank\nfile. It is helpful to name the file the same as the compression selections\nbeing tested. Open the Realtime statistics window to see whether the\nvolume levels are reflected. Select Record either with the toolbar icon, or in\nthe Tools/Multimedia menu. Record for a minute and then stop the\nrecording. Use Alt+J or Play to play the audio and evaluate the quality. Note\nthat not all selections will reflect the volume levels in the Realtime statistics\nwindow. If the volume levels do not display, then you will also not be able to\nadjust the playback speed.\nThe following GSM 6.10 selections do display the volume levels and\nallow playback speed adjustments:\nGSM compression settings:\n8.000 kHz, Mono 1kb/sec\n11.025 kHz, Mono 2kb/sec\n22.050 kHz, Mono 4kb/sec\nWorking with different Audio Codecs details are here.\nInstructions for setting up Eclipse for audio recording and playback can\nbe found here.\nSharing Audio Files With A Scopist\nAudio files by their nature are very large. They cannot be emailed by\nconventional means. Reporters and scopists who have to email audio files to\neach other do so by using a specialty large-file email service, or by\npurchasing web space and uploading/downloading the file via the Internet.\nAlso, audio files will not fit on a floppy disk. You will need to use a\nwritable CD, âthumb driveâ, or other high capacity specialty media such as\nDVDs.\nIf you have received an audio (.WAV) file and a transcript (.ECL) file\nfrom a reporter, all you have to do is is put the .WAV file in a place where\nEclipse can find it. The .WAV file must have the same name as the .ECL file.\nThe File locations section of the Programming tab tells Eclipse where to\nlook for the WAV file. By default, Eclipse will look in the same folder as the\n.ecl file. You can set other locations with the WAV=path in the File locations\non the Programming tab to have Eclipse look in a different location. (For\ndetails on File Locations, see the Reference Guide section of this manual,\npage 463.) The audio path is also contained in the Job variables.\n718\n713\n708 Eclipse Help\nYou can play audio directly off a CD, or from wherever the file\ndownloads to. For example, if you get a CD with the . WAV file on it, you can\nset your File location WAV path to D:\\(or whatever letter your CD drive is)\nand the .WAV file will play from there. You don't have to copy it into the jobs\nfolder. Since large files take a long time to copy, you may find this very\nconvenient.\nAnd that's it. You don't have to do anything in Eclipse to get them to\nâlinkâ. If the .WAV file is in any of the proper locations, you will be able to\nhear the audio. There is one other aspect of .WAV/.ECL synchronization that\nshould be mentioned.\nThe underscore _ character has a special meaning in remote live\nscoping. Basically, everything after the underscore will be ignored when\nEclipse is looking for a .WAV file to associate with an .ECL file. For example, if\nyou have a transcript file called SMITH_051104_DEPO.ECL, it will look for an\naudio file called SMITH.WAV, not\nSMITH_051104_DEPO.WAV.\nIn other words, if you're not getting the audio from an .ECL/.WAV file\nwhere the filename contains an underscore, try removing the underscore\nfrom both filenames. You can replace the underscore with a space, hyphen,\nor any other character you like. (As long as you are consistent; again, both\n.ECL and .WAV files must have the same name.)\nSynchronizing Audio\nIf the audio is ahead of or behind the transcript, there are some tools\navailable to adjust the timecodes so the audio will synchronize again.\nNOTE: Manually synchronizing audio involves manipulating timecodes.\nIf you need to produce a timecoded transcript, be sure to undo your changes\nbefore printing it and handing it in, or make the changes in a copy of the file.\nThe tools you need to manually sync up your audio are on the\nDocuments tab/Timecodes button . They are Offset and WAVe MS/Sec. You\nmay need to use one or the other, or both, depending upon the nature of the\nproblem. You may also want to use the Timecode Calculator (see p. 229 for\ndetails).\nThe Timecode offset setting allows you to apply an offset to the entire\ntranscript. For example, if your timecodes are ten seconds ahead of\nsomething you wish to synchronize to, you can apply an offset of minus ten\nseconds and they will match.\nAn offset can be plus or minus. A positive number will add time; a\nnegative number will subtract time.\nFor example, an offset of +00:00:10:00 (plus ten seconds) would\nchange a timecode from 10:30:00 AM to 10:30:10 AM; an offset of minus\nten seconds would change it from 10:30:00 AM to 10:29:50 AM.\nThe offset doesnât alter or otherwise change your âauthenticâ timecodes\nor job in any way. The offset is simply a mathematical alteration. If you want\nthe original timecodes back you can simply reset the offset to zero.\n436\nReference Guide 709\nHere is how to synchronize your timecodes with an external source:\n1. Select one particular word near the beginning of the transcript.\n2. Determine that wordâs timecode in your document. Put the cursor on the\nword, and look to the status bar at the bottom right for that strokeâs\ntimecode. It will appear like this: TC: 12:30:16. Be aware that each steno\nstroke has its own timecode, even though only one timecode will appear\nper line in the transcript. To see the timecode for a particular stroke, put\nthe cursor on that stroke and look at the status bar.\n3. Determine the timecode for the same word in the external source. For\nexample if it were a videotaped deposition, you would play that part of the\ntranscript and make a note of what the timecode was for the word being\nspoken at that time.\n4. Subtract your timecode from the external timecode to get the offset.\nIt is important to note that there is a natural delay between a word\nbeing spoken and it being translated into a transcript. If you set Timecode\nOffset to zero you will find that the transcript lags behind the sound slightly.\nThe default Timecode Offset is -00:00:03:00 (minus three seconds) for this\nreason.\nTimecode Offset will address one type of synchronization problem.\nWhen working with Timecode Offset, you may discover that the discrepancy\nis not the same throughout the transcript. You may sync part of the\ntranscript using the offset, only to find that it drifts off again later in the job.\nThis is a symptom of a different problem: a discrepancy between your\nsound recording systemâs definition of a second and an actual second.\nSome audio recording systems consider a second to be slightly shorter\nor longer than a second of actual time. Over the course of a lengthy sound\nfile, this small difference can cause tracking to drift further and further and\nfurther off.\nTo solve this problem, we must adjust the WAV ms/sec, which is an\nabbreviation for â.WAV file milliseconds per second.â We are essentially\nredefining the length of a second such that the timecodes will match up with\nthe sound file.\nTo determine if you need to adjust WAV ms/sec, get the tracking\naccurate at a point early in the document. Use Timecode Offset if you need\nto. Then go to two or three points at various places later in the document,\nand track the disparity between the timecode you put the cursor on and the\ntimecode for the sound that plays. Be sure to pick spots over the entire\nlength of the transcript to do this. If the disparity gets greater and greater\nover the course of the job, you will need to adjust WAV ms/sec.\nIf the sound file is behind the transcript, and gets further and further\nbehind as you go along (e.g., you go to page 50 and page 46 plays), increase\nWAV ms/sec.\n710 Eclipse Help\nIf the sound file is ahead of the transcript, and gets further and further\nahead as you go along (e.g., you go to page 50 and page 54 plays), decrease\nWAV ms/sec.\nWhen altering WAV ms/sec, make small changes. Try 999 or 1001 for\nyour first change. After making a change, go to the end of the job and see\nhow much closer the audio tracking is. When testing this, test it near the end\nof a job, as the disparity there is the greatest.\nExternal recording devices and timecode discrepancy\nIf you use an external voice recording device, you may find that the\nrecordings don't sync properly due to subtle time stretching or compressing\non the devices. You can use the User settings/Document/Timecodes/ms/sec\nsetting to correct this problem. With the document on the screen, if you go\ninto the ms/sec setting and change it and exit the dialog, the system will\nassume that you want to use that setting in this document and will allow it to\nmodify the playback timing.\nArchiving WAV files\nAs mentioned earlier, WAV files can be very large. Not only are they\nimpossible to email, they will quickly fill up your hard drive if left to pile up.\nAt the default compression setting of 10 kilobytes/second, an hour of audio\nwill require nearly 40 megabytes (MB) of hard drive space, or about 30 hours\nper gigabyte (GB). A typical computer hard drive size is 40 GB, so itâs\npossible to consume your entire hard drive in less than a year if you do not\narchive or delete audio files.\nMost reporters, if they need to archive an audio file, will copy it to a\nwritable CD. This storage medium lends itself very well to storing large audio\nfiles, not to mention permanent archival of the transcript itself. Once the\naudio file is copied to a CD (or two or more CDs â it never hurts to have\nbackups) you may delete the .WAV file from the hard drive.\nAlternatively, you could simply delete the audio file once you were done\nusing it to edit the transcript. Both the Eclipse File Manager and Windows\nExplorer allow you to delete the audio file without deleting the transcript or\nany other Eclipse files. The transcript, raw steno, and audio are stored in\nseparate files; to delete the audio and keep the rest, be sure to delete only\nthe file with the .WAV extension.\n22.1.1 Audio Properties\nAudio (Sound) Properties\nThere are various controls available in your Windows audio settings,\ndepending on your version of Windows. You will find ways to control Volume,\nSounds, Audio, Voice and Hardware.\nReference Guide 711\nVolume\nThe Volume area should have sections for Device volume and Speaker\nsettings, each with its own separate options. In the Device volume section\nthere will be settings to adjust the Audio volume, Mute and an option to\nplace the Volume icon in the taskbar's system tray. Enable the taskbar icon if\nit is not already, by clicking in the check box provided. There is also an\nAdvanced button available that will open the Windows Volume Controls.\nThese controls will be explained in greater detail later. For now, close the\nVolume Control window, if you clicked the Advanced button to open it.\nIn the Speaker settings section, you can control Speaker Volume and\nproperties. Clicking the properties button gives you the option of changing\nthe volume of our left and right speakers individually.\nOn the Performance page, we have a section for Audio playback where\nwe can adjust the Hardware acceleration and Sample rate conversion quality.\nThese settings should be set to the maximum allowed. Hardware acceleration\nshould be set to Full and the Sample rate conversion quality should be set to\nBest. We can always restore the system defaults by clicking the Restore\nDefaults button as well. Once you have determined that your Audio playback\noptions are set to their optimal settings, click Ok to close the Advanced Audio\nProperties window.\nThe Sounds Page\nClick the Sound tab in the Sounds and Audio Devices Properties window\n(or the System tab) to focus on the Sounds properties. Here you can setup a\nsound scheme for windows. This does not concern us for doing audio\nrecording or playback, so we will continue on to the Audio page. However, it\nshould be noted that you can change the default sounds that Windows uses\nwhen program errors occur, on system startup and shutdown. Anytime\nWindows makes a system noise, it can be changed in the Program events\nsection of the Sounds page.\nThe Audio Page\nClick the Audio tab in the Sounds and Audio Devices Properties window\nto display the Audio properties. Here we have 3 sections â Output, Input,\nand Advanced options.\n712 Eclipse Help\nThe Output section lists the Default device use to playback audio. This\nwill generally coincide with the name or driver for the audio hardware that is\ninstalled on your computer. Clicking the drop down list of Default devices\nmay display alternate devices, such as a modem. Make sure that this option\nis set to the main audio hardware for your computer. Most computers will\nonly have one option available, the system audio hardware. The Volume\nbutton in the Sound playback section will open the Volume Controls, just like\nthe Advanced button in the Device volume section of the Volume page, in the\nSounds and Audio Device Properties does. No need to click it, so we'll\ncontinue. The Advanced button will open the Advanced Audio Properties\npages, as it does in the Speaker settings section of the Volume page, in the\nSounds and Audio Device Properties. Again we've already been here, so we'll\nmove on to the Sound recording section.\nIn the Input section of the Audio page, we have a selection for the\ndefault recording device. This again should be set to the main audio\nhardware component for your system. Clicking the drop down list of Default\ndevices may display alternate devices, such as a voice modem or other\nrecording device. Most computers will only have one option available, the\nsystem audio hardware. If you use a specialized input device, such as a USB\nmicrophone, you may want to select that device instead of the main audio\nhardware. We also have a properties button that will open the Recording\nControl Panel. Here will be a row of input devices that your audio hardware\ncan use for recording. Generally you will have at least, CD Player, Microphone\nand Line In, as available controls, possibly many others. This is where we will\nadjust our microphone recording level. For starters you should make sure\nthat the Microphone level is at 50% or in the middle of the vertical slider.\nAlso make sure that there is a check in the box labeled Select, on the\nmicrophone control section. Close the Recording Control Panel for now. We\nwill revisit it in greater detail when we perform our initial recording and\nplayback tests.\nThere may or may not be an available advanced option button in the\nSound recording section. If the Advanced button is not ghosted out, you can\nclick it for additional options for your Sound recording device.\nThe last option on the Audio page is the Reset to default devices check\nbox. This need not be selected. However, if you are only using your computer\nto record and playback audio through your main audio hardware that you\nhave selected in the playback and recording sections, it is safe to check this\nbox. If you use a voice modem or any other type of voice communication\nover your computer, leave this box unchecked.\nThe Voice Page\nThere are 2 sections on the Voice page of the Sounds and Audio Device\nProperties â Voice playback and Voice recording. Both sections have the\nsame default device options as the Audio page. You should have these\noptions set to your main audio hardware device as we did previously on the\nAudio properties page. The Volume and Advanced buttons perform the same\nfunctions as their respective buttons on the Audio properties page as well.\nReference Guide 713\nThe Test Hardware button will allow you to test your audio recording\nand playback capabilities. This was intended to allow users to test their audio\ntransmission capabilities for on-line gaming. You can try this if you'd like, but\nwe will be performing our own tests later.\nThe Hardware Page or Sound Control Panel\nThe last page in the Sound and Audio Device Properties is the Hardware\npage. Here will be a list of devices that control your multimedia playback and\nrecordings. You should see any CDROM drives, your main audio hardware\ndriver, Audio Codecs, Legacy Audio Drivers, Media Control Devices, Legacy\nVideo Capture Devices and Video Codecs. There are also buttons for\nTroubleshooting and Properties available. Clicking on a device in the list, then\nclicking the Troubleshooting button will open the Windows Help and Support\nwizard to try and resolve issues with that particular device. Clicking on a\ndevice in the list, then clicking the Properties button will open that device's\nproperties pages, just as if you were opening them from within Device\nManager.\n22.1.2 Setting up Eclipse for Audio\nSetting up Eclipse to Record and Playback Real-time\nAudio\nOnce you have your desired audio format selected and saved, you will\nneed to make these settings active in Eclipse. Run Eclipse and open the user\nthat you want to configure for audio recording.\nAnytime you intend to make changes to your User Settings in Eclipse is\na good time to make a backup of your User Settings. Select the location you\nuse for backup. On the Eclipse Menubar, click the Tools menu and choose\nBackup. Select User settings only, or include your main dictionary if\ndesired, then click Next. Click each of the User Settings files that you want\nto backup. Selected settings files will be highlighted, click Next to continue.\nChoose your backup location and click the Finish button. Now, you can\ncontinue configuring Eclipse with your new audio compression settings. Open\nthe User settings (Alt+U) and select the Realtime tab.\nOn the Realtime tab is the Audio recording button, which opens the\nWAV Audio recording dialog. Click the Compression button. A list of\navailable compression opens. Choose the format settings that you had\npreviously saved as âMy Transcription Settingsâ or whatever you named it.\n714 Eclipse Help\nMaking this selection will apply the format and attribute settings that\nyou had previously configured and tested in Sound Recorder. You should\nreview the Format and Attributes fields after making your selection from the\nName field to be sure they match what you had selected in Sound Recorder.\nOnce you have confirmed your selection, click the OK button on the Select\nCompression window.\nIn the Audio settings section of the Realtime tab, there are 2 more\noptions to consider. Auto-restart is an option that will un-pause the\nrecording automatically when you start writing. If you need to be able to\nwrite realtime while the recording is paused, you will need to turn this off by\nunchecking the box.\nAuto-pause is an option that can be set to a number of minutes; if\nthere is no activity on the steno machine for that number of minutes, the\naudio recording will be paused. This button uses the same code as hitting the\npause button, so the synchronization is adjusted accordingly. However, you\nmust remember to hit the keystroke for un-pause (even if auto-restart is\nenabled) or you will loose a few seconds of audio when you resume writing.\nOnce you have configured your audio settings in User settings, click the\nUser tab to display that page of the User settings. Click the Save settings\nbutton and either overwrite your current settings with the new settings\n(Always make sure you have a current backup of your settings files before\nmaking modifications!!!) or save the current settings under a new name,\nwhich will become the new working settings file as indicated by the âUser\nfileâ field on the User page of User settings. Close the User settings and make\na new backup of your current settings.\nNow, you should have your new settings and be ready to test your\naudio synchronization in Eclipse. Unpack your steno machine and set it up, if\nit's not already, and connect the real-time cable to your computer and the\nsteno machine. Power the machine up.\nIn Eclipse, press Alt+T to start a real-time file, or from the Menubar\nchoose Production then select Translate. In the Translate notes window\nclick the Notes button and type in a name for the new translation you are\nabout to perform. Click Open or press Enter in the dialog box to make the\nselection and return to the Translate notes window.\nReference Guide 715\nIn the translation mode section, make sure Realtime is selected. You\nwill also need to make sure that the Record audio checkbox is enabled. Click\nin the box to enable or disable audio recording. A check in the box means the\noption is enabled. The Record audio option is only available when the\nRealtime translation mode is selected.\nOnce you have these options selected in the Translate notes window it's\ntime to start writing and recording. We recommend sitting in front of your\nTelevision or a radio and transcribing for a few minutes or more. Once you\nfeel you have written for a sufficient amount of time, stop your translation\n(Alt+Shift+T) and click Ok to close the translation statistics window that\nappears when translation is stopped. Now, press Ctrl+PgUp or go to the top\nof the document. Put the cursor on the first word of the transcribed text and\npress Alt+J to play the audio from your cursor's current position in the\ndocument. Note if the audio starts playing from the cursor position â it\nshould. Press Alt+H to stop your audio playback. Move your cursor to a new\nposition a couple of pages into the document and press Alt+J to play from\nthat position. Again, note if the audio starts playing from the cursor position\nas it should.\n716 Eclipse Help\nIt is important to remember that Eclipse starts playing audio from your\ncursor's current position in your document when you use the play audio\nfunction (Alt+J) which is a toggle for pause and play. You can pause (Alt+K)\nto temporarily stop your audio playback. If the Move cursor option has been\nselected in the Audio control panel (Tools/Multimedia/Control Panel) the\ncursor will move, more or less with the playback.\nAlso, you may need to adjust your audio playback and recording levels\nfrom time-to- time, especially if you use other audio capable programs with\nyour computer. Many audio programs, such as Windows Media Player will\nadjust the volume control and leave it at the last setting when you close it.\nBe sure to check these levels prior to making any recording. Playback volume\ncan be adjusted at anytime, but if the recording level isn't high enough\nduring recording, there is no way to increase the audible playback beyond\nthe computer's maximum volume control, without using something like\namplified speakers. Doing so would most likely generate quite a bit of\nbackground noise, so it is very important to check your audio recording and\nplayback levels every time you intend to record audio. Adjust them as\nneeded for the environment you will be working in. Test your audio recording\nand playback prior to starting any real-time translation when possible.\nNow that we have covered audio recording and setup in Eclipse, we'll\ndiscuss a few scenarios that may come up while using Eclipse for audio\nrecording.\nDoing Readbacks\nEclipse audio synchronization can be used to readback audio during a\ndeposition. To do this:\n1. Stop the audio recording with Alt+H or by selecting Stop from\nRealtime/Multimedia. Confirm that you want to stop the audio recording\nwhen the warning message appears.\n2. Move the cursor to the part of the transcript you wish to read back.\n3. Press Alt+J to play the audio.\nIn other words, you would play audio for a readback just the same as\nyou would when editing. The only difference is that you manually have to\nstop the recording first. (Eclipse cannot record and play back at the same\ntime.) If youâre going to do readbacks, you must be sure to start recording\nagain! Eclipse will automatically append the continuing audio recording to\nthe current .WAV file.\nAlthough you should always manually re-start recording that has been\nstopped, you can use Auto-Restart on the Realtime tab of User settings as a\nsafety measure. If checked, any sound recording will automatically resume\nwhen you start writing again. However, with the Auto-Restart feature, the\nfirst few seconds of spoken testimony may be lost in the time it takes for the\nreporter to write what has just been said. The recording does not restart until\nEclipse knows that something has been written on the writer.\nReference Guide 717\nThere is also an Auto-Pause setting, which will automatically stop audio\nrecording after a number of minutes if there is no activity on the steno\nmachine. This feature exists only because some municipalities require their\nreporters be able to prove that audio recording is stopped when the\ndeposition goes off the record. If you use both Auto-Pause and Auto-Restart,\nthere will be a brief delay and a few seconds of dropped audio before Auto-\nRestart kicks in. So only use Auto-Pause if you absolutely have to.\n22.1.3 Glossary\nGlossary\nCodec - Short for compressor/decompresser, a codec is any technology\nfor compressing and decompressing data. Codecs can be implemented in\nsoftware, hardware, or a combination of both. Some popular codecs for\ncomputer video include MPEG, Indeo and Cinepak. In telecommunications,\n(short for coder/decoder) a device that encodes or decodes a signal. For\nexample, telephone companies use codecs to convert binary signals\ntransmitted on their digital networks to analog signals converted on their\nanalog networks. The translation of a binary value into a voltage that can be\ntransmitted over a wire networks.\nLossless - A compression protocol which does not sacrifice (âloseâ) any\ndetail in compression or decompression. âLosslessâ compression formats are\nessential in applications like compressing program files or backing up data\nfrom a hard disk. In applications which don't require exact reproduction of\nthe file being compressed, a âlossyâ protocol may be used. The ZIP format\ndeveloped by PKWare is a âlosslessâ file compression protocol.\nLossy - If a process is lossy, it means that a little quality is lost when it\nis performed. If a format is lossy, it means that putting data into that format\n(or possibly even manipulating it in that format) will cause some slight loss.\nLossy processes and formats are typically used for performance or resource\nutilization reasons. The opposite of lossy is lossless.\nPCM - Pulse-Coded Modulation is a digital representation of audio in\nwhich a series of samples of the level of acoustic energy is represented by a\nseries of (arithmetically scaled) numeric values. This representation is the\nbasis of digital audio and is what people usually mean when they refer to\nuncompressed audio.\n718 Eclipse Help\nSample Rate - In a digital recorder or sampler, the sample rate is how\nmany times per second the source material is being âsampledâ or recorded.\nSample rate affects the frequency response of the final recording or sample;\nthe highest frequency that can accurately be sampled is 1/2 the sample rate.\nIn general, the higher the sample rate, the better the sound quality. But, the\nbest sample rate to use will depend on your application, your gear, and the\namount of storage available (the higher the rate, the more storage required).\nCDs use a 44.1 kHz sample rate, while DAT recorders often default to 48 kHz.\nMultimedia applications may use rates of 22.05 kHz or even 11.025 kHz for\nmaximum efficiency.\n22.1.4 Codecs\nWorking with different Audio Codecs\nAs you'll remember, audio codecs allow us to compress our audio files\nso they are smaller and easier to manage and transport. When using the\nSound Recorder program to record and playback audio, the default format for\nthe audio file is the PCM format at 8,000 kilohertz, 8-bit, mono. Prior to\nrecording audio with Sound Recorder, you can change the audio format for\nthe wave file by clicking the File menu and choosing Properties from the list.\nOn the Details page, in the Properties for Sound dialog, there is a\nsection labeled Format Conversion. This is where we can select different\ncodecs to test our audio recording. There is a âChoose fromâ drop down list\nthat will allow you to select from recording or playback formats. The default\nâAll formatsâ will be sufficient. You shouldn't need to make any changes\nthere. We also have a Convert Now button that allows us to make a new\naudio format selection. Click the Convert Now button to open the Sound\nSelection window.\nIn the Sound Selection window, we have 3 modifiable fields â Name,\nFormat and Attributes. You won't need to be too concerned with the Name\nfield, just yet. Once you have determined your optimal recording levels and\naudio file format you can save the format under a user defined name, by\nclicking the Save As button, that will be available to you in Eclipse. We do\nnot recommend overwriting any of the pre-defined settings that are already\navailable, such as Radio Quality, Telephone Quality, etc.\nThe Format field allows you to choose from any of the audio codecs\navailable on your computer to change the compression method. From our\nexperiences, many reporters use the GSM 6.10 audio codec for transcription\nrecording. You may want to start with this codec when testing your\ncomputer's recording and playback capabilities using a compressed audio\nformat. Again, depending on your audio hardware, you may get excellent or\npoor results using any codec. Go ahead and select the GSM 6.10 format from\nthe Format drop-down list now.\nReference Guide 719\nThe Attributes field allows us to fine tune our Format selection. Clicking\nthe available drop down list reveals possible format attributes for the chosen\nFormat. The default format that appears when GSM 6.10 is selected is 8,000\nkHz, Mono which will produce a file of about 1 kb per second of recording.\nThis is approximately 10 times smaller than the Telephone Quality PCM\nformat and 7 times smaller than the default PCM format we used to test our\nfirst audio recording a few moments ago. But remember, compression rates\nlike these will affect the quality of your audio recording and playback, so we\nwill enter the testing phase again shortly. For the mean time, leave the\ndefault GSM 6.10 attributes alone. We will do our next audio recording with\nthis format and the current attributes. Click the Ok button on the Sound\nSelection window to return to the Properties for Sound dialog. Click Ok on\nthis page to return to the Sound recorder interface.\nRight away, you should notice that the black and green waveform\nviewer in the the center of the Sound Recorder window is completely grey.\nThis waveform viewer is only available when you are using an uncompressed\naudio format such as PCM -- Sound Recorder's default. Since the codecs we\nwill be testing are all compressed audio formats, this viewer will not be\navailable for the rest of your tests, unless you switch back to the PCM format,\nor close Sound Recorder and re-open it.\nTesting Audio Recording with a Compressed Format\nNow that you have selected the GSM 6.10 audio format you'll need to\nrecord another wave file and play it back to determine if the quality of the\ncompressed format will be acceptable. Click the File menu in Sound Recorder\nand choose New from the list. Click No to discard the current audio file and\nstart a new one. Click the Record button to start your audio recording. Repeat\nthe following text:\nâThis is a test. We are recording audio with the GSM 6.10 format at\n8,000 kilohertz, mono. End of test.â\nClick the Stop button to the left of the Record button to stop the audio\nrecording. Click the center Play button to playback your audio recording.\nYou may need to try other formats and attributes to get the desired\nlevel of quality from your audio recordings. For the sake of brevity, we cannot\ndocument each possible format and attribute combination. It will be up to\nyou to use the information we have provided to test your computer's audio\nrecording capability and determine the best format and attributes for your\nhardware. We recommend that you make a note of each selection you try,\nand to mention the format and attributes you have selected, in the text that\nyou read aloud when testing your audio recordings. If desired, you can save\nthe test wave files, with descriptive names, so that you can refer to them\nlater.\n720 Eclipse Help\nFor practical purposes, remember that it is best to test your audio\nrecording in an actual working setting with people talking like they would if\nyou were in a real-time session, deposition, or whatever situation that you\nplan to implement audio recording. Do not speak directly into the microphone\nwhen testing, unless that is how your speakers will be recorded during\ntranscription. Walk a few feet away from the computer and try to simulate\nthe environment you will be working in. Speaking in normal tones will give\nyou the best results when selecting recording levels.\nOnce you have completed these tests and selected the optimum levels\nfor recording and playback, and have chosen a compression format which\nprovides good quality audio and smaller file sizes, doing real-time\ntranscription with audio sync in Eclipse will be a snap. You should save your\nAudio format settings under a user defined name that you can select within\nEclipse.\nTo save your audio format settings, open the Properties for Sound in the\nSound Recorder File Menu, and click the Convert Now button. Make sure that\nyour Format and Attribute settings conform to what you have tested and\nchosen to be acceptable, then click the Save As button on the Sound\nSelection window. Type in a descriptive name, such as âEclipse Transcription\nSettingsâ, then click the Ok button to save the settings under this name. You\nwill be able to access these settings, under this name, within Eclipse. We'll\nexplain how, in the next section of this document. Click OK on the Sound\nSelection window then click OK to close the Properties for Sound dialog.\nYou can close any open Control Panels and the Sound Recorder\napplication when your testing is completed.\n22.2 Automatic Proofreading: Editing the Rules\nAutomatic Proofreading: Editing the Proofreading\nRules\nIn order for the proofreader to work, it must have a set of rules defined\nunder User settings/Programming/Proofreading rules. These rules are\nwhat make it all work.\nThere is a separate list under User\nsettings/Programming/Watchwords that is used by the proofreader to\ncall your attention, briefly, to words that often require a second look to make\nsure they're really the word you wanted.\nAlso, the default proofreading rules contain a special code that will\nmark any punctuation error that would be flagged as invalid punctuation by\nthe spelling checker, which follows the exceptions specified in the User\nsettings/Programming/Spelling exceptions.\nReference Guide 721\nIf your proofreading rules are empty, the load user function will load\nnot only the default proofreading rules created by Keith Vincent, but will also\npre-load a series of specialized suffixes and macros designed specifically for\nthe proofreader's AutoMagic feature described above. If you have used a\nprevious version of the software and wish to use the new rules, remove all of\nthe previous proofreading rules and re-load your user to trigger the\nautomatic import.\nThe syntax for a rule is as follows.\nDescription=regular expression pattern{e}exception regular expression\npattern\nThe exception pattern is optional. The basic concept is that if the\nregular expression pattern is found anywhere in the text of a paragraph, that\nis a likely error and should get extra attention. If the exception pattern can\nbe found inside the matched text, however, then it's not actually an error and\nwill be ignored. This allows for many broad errors to be found that have a few\ncases that are considered correct.\nExample: Double text=(.+) \\1{e}<had> <:\\w*><had>|<that> <:\n\\w*><that>\nThis expression would find a string of at least one character, followed by\na space, followed by an exact copy of the first string (the \\1 is a\nbackreference to the first pattern in parentheses.) However, it's not an error\nif the entire pattern contains \"had had\" or \"that that\" because those do\nappear normally in text.\nIn order to be able to find errors related to the grammar of the\nsentence in a general sense, it has to have access to the parts of speech of\nthe text. In order to make that possible, the regex search does NOT compare\nthe pattern against the raw text. There's not enough information there. It\nrequires parts of speech, possibly knowing what paragraph type is being\nused, and where lockspaces are (represented by the ~ symbol.)\nInstead, the regex pattern analyzes a âtaggedâ version of the text with\nparts of speech in it. You can see the tagged version of the text by using the\nTools/Hidden text feature. For example, the tagged version of a simple\nquestion might look like this:\n<<Q>><:a><What> <:o><do> <:p><you> <:nv><say>\n<:p><you> <:v><remembered>?\nThe <<Q>> is the paragraph type, and will show the same letter as the\nparagraph buttons. It also serves as a way to recognize the start of the\nparagraph, since >> will always mean the start (you can use $ as the end as\nwith normal regexes.)\nThe text is then coded with every word having the part of speech before\nit, and anything that is not a word appearing outside the < > symbols, such\nas spaces, punctuation, etc. The coding is simply this:\n<:part(s) of speech><word>non-word\nParts that can be combined:\n722 Eclipse Help\nt â article\nn â noun\nv â verb\nj â adjective\na â adverb\ne â preposition\nc â conjunction\nParts that stand alone:\np â pronoun\nz â contraction\ns â posessive\ny - âthatâ\nr â number\nb â âbeâ forms\nh - âhaveâ forms\nd - âdoâ forms\nk - âcanâ forms\nw - âwhoâ forms\nx - âwhatâ forms\ng - âgoâ forms\no â proper noun\nExample:\n<:p><you> <:h><have> <:T><a> <:nv>meeting\nKeep in mind that any regex you write can choose to ignore or filter any\npart of either the parts of speech or the word itself, depending on whether\nyou are doing a search for a particular part of speech, or a particular word,\nregardless of parts of speech.\nYou can use {c} at the beginning of a pattern to force it to be casesensitive.\nIn order to match any sequence of letters, the easiest pattern is \\w+ or\n\\w* (at least one, or any number of, word-based characters.)\nSo in order to match âthey goesâ you cannot simply put âthey goesâ in\nas a pattern. You would put <they> <:g><goes> instead. Note that the\nspace is outside the brackets.\nReference Guide 723\nWhen searching for a particular word, you don't need to also match the\npart of speech, so instead of looking it up, you can leave it blank. <:> in the\npattern means any part of speech, so even though you know that \"the dog\" is\narticle/noun, you should just use <:><the> <:><dog> instead of <:t>the\n<:n><dog>. Parts of speech are tricky: \"dog\" can also be used as a verb, so\n<:n><dog> would fail to match. You would need to use <:nv><dog>. Better\nto just leave it blank and match anything.\nYou can also use a special <.> tag to match any word if you ONLY care\nabout the part of speech. <:n><.> would match any word that can only be a\nnoun. So, for example, if you wanted to search for Pronoun followed by\nArticle, you would use <:p><.> <:t>\nNote that you can use any regex syntax inside those braces. They're not\na search command, they're specifically what you're searching for. In\nparticular, if you're combining the nvja letters, note that they will always\nappear in the order listed above, but may not always be present. So <:n?v>\nmeans to match either <:nv> or <:v> because the n may or may not be\nthere (? means one or zero) so you're matching a word that's a verb and may\nor may not be usable as a noun.\n<:nv?j?> would be a noun that could be a verb or could be an\nadjective. Don't forget the brackets for either/ors for single characters. <:\n[ec]> matches a preposition or a conjunction. If you need either/or for\nstrings, use (this|that|other). For example, you could use <:><(dog|cat)>\nto match either the word dog or cat.\nThe existing items are good examples of how this works. There are\nsome that work based on just the parts of speech and ignore the words,\nothers that require specific words, and others that combine them.\nYou can use \"watchwords,\" which appear on the status bar, but will\nauto-unhighlight as the cursor passes over them, to create watchwords with\nadditional regular expression syntax, such as =librar(y|ies) or =MFC\\d+ that\napply to more than one specific word.\nYou'll make yourself crazy writing regexes without a tool to test them.\nThe easiest thing to do is use Notepad++, copy/paste in the tagged text\nfrom the Hidden Text feature, then try the regex search in Notepad++ (make\nsure it's case sensitive!) and see if you can get a match. Use smaller\nsearches if it's not working and gradually work your way up.\nUse \\ when searching for these characters: .?()[]^${} For example, use\n\\. or \\?\nTech support will be happy to help develop or modify regular\nexpressions to make the proofreading rules fit with your particular style of\nediting.\n22.3 Connection Magic on a LAN\nConnection Magic on a LAN\n724 Eclipse Help\nConnection Magic Local is server software that enables you to use\nConnection Magic when there is no internet available.\nConnection Magic Local (CM Local) uses a wireless router, along with\nsoftware provided by Advantage Software, to create a Local Area Network\n(LAN) running the same Connection Magic server that is used online by\nAdvantage Software. Being able to run in a non-internet setting is ideal for\ncourthouses where the internet may not be available, or for portable use.\nWhen you want to send your realtime data to clients running Bridge or Bridge\nMobile, but don't have internet access, you can use CMLocal, with a Bridge\nBroadcaster.\nTo set up Connection Magic Local:\n1. Purchase a wireless router, and a Bridge Broadcaster from Advantage\nSoftware.\n2. Obtain the CMLocal software from Advantage Software.\n3. Run the program. When the \"Welcome to Connection Magic Setup\"\nscreen appears, click Next.\n4. The next screen let's you \"Choose install location.\" Generally, you\nshould accept the default by clicking Install.\n5. The last screen says \"Connection Magic Local has been installed on\nyour computer.\" Click Finish.\n6. When the program is finished installing, there will be a Connection\nMagic Local icon on your desktop\nTo start a session, double click the desktop icon.\nThe Connection Magic Server opens a window, showing that the Server has\nstarted.\n1210\nReference Guide 725\nYou do not need to do anything but let it run.\nThere is an IP address, but you only need to use this if your client(s) will use\na web browser to connect to Bridge Mobile.\n22.4 CustomSearches\nSearches: Custom searches\nRELATES TO: Find (F5)\nCreating regular expressions and Backreferences\nA regular expression is a way of expressing a variable search pattern\nusing a series of special command characters and command character\nsequences. They follow several special rules:\nâ¢ The backslash can be used to specify a literal character. For example,\nif you try to search for $5 it might fail because the $ sign is used to\nspecify the termination of a paragraph. If you search for \\$5 the \\\ntells the system to treat the next character as plain text, not as a\ncommand. If you need to search for a backslash, use \\\\\n320\n726 Eclipse Help\nâ¢ Every expression consists of a sequence of characters to search for.\nEach character actually consists of two parts: The character to search\nfor immediately followed by the number of times that character is\npermitted (or required) to appear to be considered a match. The\nnumber of times is optional, and if left out, then the number is\nconsidered to be exactly one. For example, a regular expression of\nâdogâ is a pattern consisting of âdâ exactly once, âoâ exactly once and\nâgâ exactly once. The ? Symbol means that the previous character is\noptional, so âbo?atâ would find either âboatâ or âbat.â\nâ¢ If there is a need to group together several characters to be part of a\nrepeating pattern (or to store a pattern of multiple characters for reuse\nlater) the parentheses are used. For example, ât(hr)?oughâ would\nfind either âthroughâ or âtoughâ because the ? symbol made the\nentire sequence in the parens optional, not just the previous\ncharacter.\nThere is a helper dialog that appears if you select Custom search on\neither one of the shortcut lists in the Find dictionary entries dialog. This\nhelper dialog is a Custom search builder which makes the process of\ncreating regular expressions much easier.\n22.4.1 Custom Search Builder\nCustom search builder\nReference Guide 727\nThe process of creating a custom search filter is a process of deciding what\nelements you are looking for in dictionary entries and how best to represent them. For\nsome entries, itâs simple, but for others, it may be more complicated if youâre looking\nfor a broad range of entries of a particular type. For example, searching for a conflict is\neasy because all you have to do is look for a backslash. But what if you were looking\nfor all of your speaker entries that contained additional text, such as â{S:THE COURT}\nOverruledâ? The easiest part of the dialog is the âentry must start/end with patternâ\ncheckboxes. Simply put, when you specify a pattern to search for, it can normally be\nfound ANYWHERE in the entry and it will be considered a matching entry. You must\ncheck one or both of these boxes if you wish to limit the search. You can do this either\nbefore or after defining the rest of the pattern. This dialog creates the regular\nexpression syntax for you, but here is the syntax so that you will know what youâre\nlooking at.\nEntry must start with pattern : Regular expression syntax: ^pattern\nEntry must end with pattern : Regular expression syntax: pattern$\nExample: ^the\nMatches: the, theory, there\nNon-matches: lathe, other, dog.\nExample: the$\nMatches: the, lathe\nNon-matches: theory, there, dog\nExample: ^the$\nMatches: the\nNon-matches: everything else\nThe start/end checkboxes are only selected once for the entire pattern. The 1-2-3\nsteps on the left side of the dialog can be selected as many times as you like to create\nthe entire pattern. Here is a description of those steps:\n1. Text to match\nFirst, you must select how you intend to define the text. Do you want a specific\npiece of text, or are you looking for something more general? Here is a list of the\ndifferent categories of text patterns that appear on the list in step one:\nThis specific text\nThis allows you to specify a particular piece of text, such as the text âtheâ in the\nprevious example. You would select this item and then type âtheâ in the âtextâ box.\n(Regular expression syntax: None. Text is text. However, if any of the text you\nare going to search for contains characters that are used as commands in regular\nexpressions you must precede them by a \\ character. For example, searching for âA+â\nmeans âsearch for one or more instances of Aâ and will find A or AA or AAA. If you\nactually want to search for A+ you have to search for A\\+. This step is automated for\nyou if you use the dialog to specify your search text.)\nAny of the following characters\n728 Eclipse Help\nThis allows you to specify several characters, any of which can be matched. For\nexample, if you were looking for a punctuation mark, you might select this item and\nthen type â.,?;:â in the text box.\n(Regular expression syntax: [characters]. For example, [abc] would find any of\nthe characters a, b or c.)\nA character NOT of the following\nThis is the reverse of the previous item. You can have the pattern match any\ncharacter not belonging to a particular set of characters. For example, if you wanted to\nfind entries that were not conflicts or commands, you could select this item and type\nâ\\{â in the text box.\n(Regular expression syntax: [^characters]. For example, [^abc] would find any\ncharacter that is not a, b or c.)\nA range of characters\nThis is a helpful shortcut if youâre looking for a bunch of characters that are all\nconsecutive. Note that when you select this, a hyphen appears in the box. Thatâs a hint\nthat you need to put a hyphen between characters in the range. For example, if you\nwanted to look for a capital letter, select this item and type A-Z in the text box.\n(Regular expression syntax: [start-end]. For example, [A-Z] would find a capital\nletter. Note that this is part of the âset of charactersâ syntax and the two can be\ncombined together within the same brackets by a creative regular expression user. For\nexample, [a-zA!] will match any of the letters a through z or the capital letter A or an\nexclamation point.)\nA character NOT in this range\nThe reverse of the previous item. If you select this item and type a-z in the list\nit will match anything that is NOT a lower-case letter.\n(Regular expression syntax: [^start-end])\nReference Guide 729\nThe following selections do not require the user to enter any text manually in the\ntext box, because they have very specific meanings and supply their own syntax.\nAny character\nThis allows you to skip text you donât care about if you donât care what it looks\nlike. For example, if you were looking for a number command, you might put in {#,\nthen tell it âany characterâ, then } after that.\n(Regular expression syntax: . (the period.) Example: d.g matches dig or dog or\neven d!g or d=g.)\nAny word character\nFor the purpose of regular expressions, a word character is any number or letter.\n(Regular expression syntax: \\w Example: {\\w would match {Q but not {#.)\nAny digit\nYou could do this by doing a range of characters [0-9] but itâs such a common\nneed that a regular expression shortcut was created for it.\n(Regular expression syntax: \\d Example: \\d- would match 5-day but not x-ray.\nAny non-word character\nThis item matches any character that is not a letter or number.\n(Regular expression syntax: \\W (capital w.))\nAny non-digit\n730 Eclipse Help\nThis item matches any character that is not a digit.\n(Regular expression syntax: \\D (capital d.))\nA word boundary\nThis matches the edge of a word, no matter whether itâs a non-word character or\nthe beginning or end of an entry. For example, if you wanted to search for any entry\nCONTAINING the WORD âtheâ you could put a âword boundaryâ on either side of it so\nthat it would only find âtheâ if it was surrounded by word boundaries in the entry.\n(Regular expression syntax: \\b Examples: \\bthe\\b will find âtheâ or âthe dogâ or\nâon-the-jobâ but will NOT match âbatheâ or âotherâ or âthere.â)\n2. Number of repetitions permitted\nAfter selecting the text you wish to match, you may need to explain how many\ntimes that text can come up. Each of the syntaxes above is designed to match a single\ncharacter if not modified, but you may wish to match more than that, or possibly even\nless if the text youâre looking for may or may not be present. You MUST select how\nmany repetitions are permitted for the text that youâre looking for.\nNote that if you use anything other than âexactly onceâ on a âthis specific textâ\nsequence it will appear in parentheses so that the system knows that you are\nrepeating the entire sequence a certain number of times, rather than simply the last\nletter in the sequence.\nIn regular expression syntax, these number specifiers always go immediately\nafter the text that has been specified. Here is a list of the choices on this menu along\nwith some examples.\nExactly once\nThis specifies that it will attempt to match the pattern exactly once. Select this\nfor situations where you are only looking for a single character or if you have specified\na particular word or sequence of letters.\n(Regular expression syntax: none. This is the default behavior of any pattern.)\nZero or more times\nThis allows you to specify that the text can be matched any number of times,\nincluding not at all.\n(Regular expression syntax: * Example: d[a-z]*r would find d followed by any\nnumber of lower case letters followed by r, so it would match the following: door, dear,\ndar, dr. One of the most common uses of this is the âmatch anythingâ sequence, which\nis .* (period asterisk) which, literally, is any character any number of times. {.*}\nwould find any Eclipse command, for example, including an empty one.)\nAt least once\nThis specifies that a pattern should have least one of something to differentiate it\nfrom other entries.\nReference Guide 731\n(Regular expression syntax: + Example: Exhibit \\d+ would find âExhibitâ\nfollowed by a space followed by at least one digit. It would match the following:\nExhibit 1, Exhibit 236, Exhibit 27B. It would NOT match Exhibit A. However, if you\nspecified Exhibit \\d* it would match Exhibit A because the number of digits is zero,\nwhich is acceptable when using the âzero or more timesâ option.)\nExactly this many times\nSometimes, you need to find a pattern a specific number of times. If you select\nthis choice, the âNumberâ box will be enabled and you will be able to type in a\nparticular number of times.\n(Regular expression syntax: {number} Example: [a-z]{3} would find exactly\nthree lower-case letters in a row somewhere in a dictionary entry. If you turned on the\nMust start/end boxes as well, you would end up with ^[a-z]{3}$ which would find all\nof the three-letter words in your dictionary.)\nAt least this many times\nThis is very similar to the previous item, but can have that many or more\nrepetitions of a pattern. Once again, it enables the number box for you to supply the\nnumber.\n(Regular expression syntax: {number,} Example: \\d{2,} would find any\ndictionary entry that contained a sequence of two or more digits anywhere in it.)\nA range of times\nOn very rare occasions, you may need to find a specific range of times a\nparticular pattern appears in entries. This item will enable the âMaximumâ box for you\nto specify a maximum number of times a pattern can appear in an entry.\n(Regular expression syntax: {number,max} Example: [A-Z]{2,5} would match\na sequence of at least two but no more than five capital letters in a row.)\n3. Add text to pattern\nOnce you have selected the text and the repetitions, you then press this button\nto add the text specified to the pattern. You can repeat steps 1 through 3 as many\ntimes as necessary to create the pattern you are looking for.\nHere is an example of the process of creating two regular expressions using this\ndialog.\nLetâs say Iâm looking for any speaker entry that contains text after the speaker,\nsuch as {S:THE COURT}Overruled\nUsing the menus on the dialog, I would select this:\n1.This specific text: {S: 2. Exactly once 3. Add\n1.Any character 2. Zero or more times 3. Add\n1.This specific text: } 2. Exactly once 3. Add\n1.Any word character 2. At least once 3. Add\nThe regular expression would end up being:\n{S:.*}\\w+\n732 Eclipse Help\nThat would find any speaker followed by text in the same entry.\nHINT: Remember to use the Entry must start/end items appropriately. For\nexample, if you did NOT want the previous search to match â{--}{S:MR. JONES}Noâ\nyou would have to make it ^{S:.*}\\w+ instead by checking the âEntry must start with\nthis pattern.â\nThe process of coming up with a complete regular expression that does EXACTLY\nwhat you want it to do may take several tries to get it right. For example, creating the\nâAll capsâ search on the list took several false starts. Let's go through an example of\nhow you have to try building it up from a few elements until you get exactly what you\nwant.\n[A-Z]+ (at least one upper case letter.)\nMatches: FBI, Ph.D., John\nNo good. That search will match any dictionary entry that contains a sequence of\nat least one capital letter anywhere in it, but that's not âAll caps.â\n^[A-Z]+$ (at least one capital letter, and the entry must start and end with that\nsequence.)\nMatches: FBI, UNICEF, IEEE\nNon-matches: D.A.R.E., I.D., I-95, {Q}, {S:THE COURT}\nStill no good. It only matches entries that contain ONLY upper-case letters. Iâm\ninterested in any dictionary that simply has no lower-case letters in it. Maybe that\napproach will work:\n^[^a-z]*$ (the entire entry must be a sequence of any number of characters\nthat are not lower case letters.)\nMatches: FBI, D.A.R.E., I.D., I-95, {S:THE COURT}, {.}, {-}, {,}, {--}, etc.\nStill not right. Now itâs matching all of my punctuation entries, because they\ndonât contain lower case letters, so they match the pattern perfectly.\nWhat I need to do is match a dictionary entry that contains a sequence that\nconsists entirely of non-lower case letters, whether theyâre at the beginning or end of\nthe entry, but has at least one upper case letter in it somewhere. Now we have it:\n^[^a-z]*[A-Z]+[^a-z]*$\nThe entry must contain only a sequence of zero or more non-lower-case letters,\nfollowed by at least one upper case letter, followed by a sequence of zero or more nonlower-\ncase letters. Thatâs what you get when you select âall capsâ from the shortcut\nlist, and thatâs what I was looking for.\nSearching for This or that\nYou can have an expression that looks for one piece of text or another\nspecifically. The regular expression syntax is to use the pipe sign | as the âorâ symbol.\nFor example, dog|cat is an expression that will search for the words âdogâ or âcatâ in a\ndictionary entry (actually, it will search for any word that contains either dog or cat, so\nit would find dogged and catalog and concatenate.)\nReference Guide 733\nThe or | symbol is always the lowest priority when the system interprets the\nexpression, so if you want to make only PART of the expression an either/or option,\nyou must enclose the either/or option in parentheses.\nBad example:\n{S:THE COURT|WITNESS} would search for any entry that contains â{S:THE\nCOURTâ or âWITNESS}â because the | separates the ENTIRE expression in to two\neither/or parts.\nGood example:\n{S:THE (COURT|WITNESS)} would find any entry containing â{S:THE COURT}â\nor â{S:THE WITNESS}â\nYou can use the | in combination with all of the other syntaxes given above.\nUser-definable search shortcuts\nThere are two additional categories in the User settings |Programming tab for\nsteno and text regular expression filters.\nThe syntax for an entry is description=regularexpression\nFor example, you could add the following line to the steno filters:\nNumber bar entries=[0-9#]\nThis would find any steno that contained any digit from 0 to 9 or the # symbol,\nwhich will match any entry that contains the number bar.\nOn the Find menu, only \"Number bar entries\" will appear. When selected, it will\nput [0-9#] in the filter box.\nIf you have a filter that requires additional user input for each use, simply add {}\nto the filter in the location where you would like the input. This allows you to make\ngeneralized searches that are very specific to the particular way that you personally\ntend to format things in your dictionary. For example, you could add the following to\nthe text filters:\nAttorney number={S:ATTY{}}\nThis expression would ask you for additional input if you picked it during a\nsearch. You could type 3[enter] and then it would search for {S:ATTY3}\n22.4.2 Regular Expressions and Backreferences\nRegular Expressions and Backreferences\nReplacing with regular expressions\nThe find/replace also follows regular expression rules, which means that if you\nwish to do anything other than a very basic replace-this-text-with-that-text you will\nhave to create an expression that does what you really want.\nHere are some simple examples, followed by some more complex ones:\n734 Eclipse Help\nSearch: the Matches: the, there, bathe, other.\nReplace: www Replace results: www, wwwre, lawww, owwwr.\nThis \"the\" example is given to show not only how many different things can\nmatch, but what gets replaced in the event that a match is found. A basic find/replace\nwill find the text anywhere in any entry and will replace ONLY the text that is searched\nfor.\nSearch: ^Smith$ Matches: Smith\nReplace: Smythe Replace results: Smythe\nNote that in this example, the ^ and $ boundary markers (created when you use\n\"Exact match\") mean that it will NOT replace the text \"Smith\" when it's part of a\nlonger entry like \"Smithson\"\nSearch: {.}{\"} Matches: {.}{\"} Ok{.}{\"} Yes{.}{\"}\nReplace {.\"} Replace results: {.\"} Ok{.\"} Yes{.\"}\nThis example illustrates that the partial search/replace can be very useful when\nre-arranging the way you have encoded certain special commands if you have used\nthem in multiple dictionary entries. This specific example uses the more recent,\nconcise form of period/end-quote which avoids the use of the toggling quote for\nreporters who don't use it.\nHere are some search/replace strings that will cause problems, and the solution:\nSearch: Exhibit \\d\nMatches: Exhibit 1 Exhibit 27 Exhibit 736B\nReplace: Exhibit{~}\nReplace results: Exhibit{~} Exhibit{~}7 Exhibit{~}36B\nSearch: ^pre\\w+\nMatches: prevent preordained preemptive preColumbian\nReplace: pre-\nReplace results: pre- pre- pre- pre-\nIt's important to realize that if you're creating a regular expression pattern to be\nmatched, the entire matching pattern will be replaced.\nIn the first example, I'm trying to find any entry that contains Exhibit, a space,\nand followed by a digit. I then want to replace it with Exhibit and a lockspace instead.\nThe trouble is, the digit is part of my pattern matching string, so the match it\nfinds in \"Exhibit 27\" that matches the pattern is, precisely, \"Exhibit 2\" and that's\nexactly what it replaces with \"Exhibit{~}\" resulting in Exhibit{~}7.\nWith the second example, it's even worse. I'm looking for every entry starting\nwith \"pre\" so that I can selectively answer yes/no and replace a lot of them with the\nhyphenated prefix instead.\nReference Guide 735\nUnfortunately, I've chosen to match the beginning of an entry ^ followed by\n\"pre\" followed by \\w+ which means ONE OR MORE word-based characters (letters.)\nSo what happens is that the search pattern does find the correct entries, but the\nmatch pattern matches the entire word, so when it goes to replace the pattern with\n\"pre-\" it will replace the entire pattern, not just the \"pre\" part.\nThe solution? Something in the regular expression syntax called\n\"backreferences.\"\nBackreferences\nIf I want to include part of my search expression in my replace string, I can do\nthat. Backreferences allow you to take matched sequences of text and re-use them\neither in the search pattern or in the replacement. The number of the backreference\nindicates which sequence in parentheses you want to re-use. If I insert \\1 into the\nreplace string, it will include the first backreference. \\2 includes the second, \\3 the\nthird, etc.\nA \"backreference\" will copy part of the original string that matches a part of the\npattern that I place in parentheses.\nFor example, if you search for\n(Mr.|Mrs.) Smith, do you recognize Exhibit ([A-Z])\nit will find either Mr. or Mrs., then the rest of the sentence with any Exhibit letter\nfrom A â Z. Once it finds that string, the backreference \\1 will either contain the Mr. or\nMrs., and the backreference \\2 will contain whatever Exhibit letter was found.\nHere's an example of a backreference being used in a replace string:\nSearch for:\nreal time (job|reporter)\nReplace with:\nrealtime \\1\nThat search and replace will turn the following sentence:\nWhen a real time reporter takes a real time job, viewers see the text very close to\nthe real time when it was spoken.\ninto the following result:\nWhen a realtime reporter takes a realtime job, viewers see the text very close to\nthe real time when it was spoken.\n736 Eclipse Help\nThis example replaces the phrase âreal timeâ with ârealtimeâ only if it is followed\nby the word âjobâ or âreporterâ. Since the search string actually includes the word\nâjobâ or âreporterâ as part of the pattern to be matched, the replace function will have\nto replace it. Using the backreference will ensure that the replacement will include the\nword that was originally found.\nHere is another example, similar to one used above for Regular Expressions:\n^pre(\\w+)\nIt's the same search pattern I used before, but this time I've included the \\w+ in\nparens. It will still match the same patterns, but everything inside the parens is\nconsidered backreference 1.\nSo if I use the following replace string:\npre-\\1\nI will get the correct results:\nSearch: ^pre(\\w+)\nMatches: prevent preordained preemptive preColumbian\nReplace: pre-\\1\nReplace results: pre-vent pre-ordained pre-emptive pre-Columbian (note\nthat I would not want to answer \"yes\" to all of these when given the choice.)\nHere's one more example of a search/replace that you could do with\nbackreferences that would be impossible any other way.\nLet's say you wanted to replace all of your \"Somethingorother University\" entries\nwith \"Somethingorother{~}University\"\nYou could try replacing \" University\" with \"{~}University\" but that would also\nreplace things like \"the University of...\" and \"1234 University Ave.\" and even the word\nâUniversityâ by itself, so you would be stuck having to answer yes/no to all of them in\norder to catch the specific ones that should not have a lockspace before them.\nSo what would be best is an expression which looks for the word \"University\"\npreceded by a space, preceded by a capitalized word, and replacing it with that same\ncapitalized word, a lockspace, and the word \"University\" again.\nHere's a sample of how that could be done:\nSearch: ([A-Z]\\w+) University\nReplace: \\1{~}University\nRegular expression give you ways to modify dictionary entries without having to\ndo a dozen different search and replaces, and without having to answer yes/no to\nevery one just to catch things that match your search because it wasn't specific\nenough.\nReference Guide 737\nUsing backreferences in searches\nOne more thing about backreferences. You are not limited to using them as part\nof a replace string. You can use a backreference in a search string if some part of what\nyou are searching for is something that repeats.\nFor example, if you want to search for any two-stroke entries where both strokes\nare the same, such as -FPLT/-FPLT or PWOB/PWOB or STPHAO/STPHAO the steno\nsearch would be as follows:\n^([^ ]+) \\1$\nTranslation: A search consisting exactly of any number of non-spaces, followed\nby a space, followed by a copy of the sequence of non-spaces matched earlier (in the\nparentheses.)\nOr, let's say you wanted to search for all of your \\yes\\{,}yes \\no\\{,}no\n\\okay\\{,}okay conflicts and replace the whole entry with a more efficient soft comma\nentry instead: {,?}yes {,?}no {,?}okay\nThe search/replace would look like this:\nSearch: \\\\(\\w+)\\\\{,}\\1 (Translation: A backslash, followed by one or more word\ncharacters, followed by \\{,} followed by an exact copy of the sequence of word\ncharacters matched earlier\nReplace: {,?}\\1\nYou could even expand it to handle both entries containing {,}word and {;} word\nto change it to a soft semicolon {;?}\nSearch: \\\\(\\w+)\\\\{(,|;)}\\1\nReplace: {\\2?}\\1\nThe searches that you can pick from the list contain backreferences that you can\nuse inside replacements without having to construct your own complex regular\nexpressions.\nThese backreferences are part of the default settings that will be used when you\ncreate a new user or when you import the Eclipse.set file (they're considered part of\nthe \"Edit\" settings.)\nHere are the searches that contain backreferences, what those backreferences are\nand examples of how you might use them.\nSteno search backreferences\nContains keys\n\\1 = Everything before the keys\n\\2 = Everything after the keys\nSearch: *F Replace: AO\\2 Results: *FPLT --> AOPLT, H*FPL --> AOPL\n738 Eclipse Help\nStarts with keys\n\\1 = Everything after the keys\nSearch: TK Replace: \\1DZ Results: TKAOEU --> AOEUDZ\nStarts with stroke(s)\n\\1 = All of the remaining strokes\nSearch: KW-GS Replace: \\1 KW-GS Results: KW-GS HEL HROE --> HEL HROE\nKW-GS\nEnds with keys\n\\1 = Everything before the keys\nEnds with stroke(s)\n\\1 = All of the prior strokes\nDouble strokes\n\\1 = The doubled stroke\nReplace: \\1Z Results: TOP TOP --> TOPZ\nAll searches referring to numbers of strokes\n\\1 = Stroke 1\n\\2 = Stroke 2\n\\3 = Stroke 3, etc.\nSearch: 3 strokes Replace: \\1 RE PHRAEUS \\3 Results: EBGS APL PEL --> EBGS\nRE PHRAEUS PEL\nText search backreferences\nContains\n\\1 = Everything before the text\n\\2 = Everything after the text\nSearch: {A} Replace: \\2{A} Results: {A}okay --> okay{A}\nReference Guide 739\nStarts with\n\\1 = Everything after the text\nCapitalized\n\\1 = Everything but the capital letter\nPhrases of a particular number of words\n\\1 = first word\n\\2 = second word\n\\3 = third word, etc.\nAlphabets\n\\1 = Everything before the letter\n\\2 = The letter itself\n\\3 = Everything after the letter\nReplace: \\1--\\2--\\3 Results: {&B} --> {&--B--}, {^K^} --> {^--K--^}\nAlphabets (Glue symbols)\n\\1 = the glue item\nReplace: {\\1^} Results: {&(a)} --> {(a)^}, Exhibit{&B} --> Exhibit{B^}\nNumbers (written)\n\\1 = the number word\nPrefixes\n\\1 = the text of the prefix\nReplace: \\1-{^} Results: {pre^} --> pre-{^}\nSuffixes\n\\1 = the text of the suffix\nSpeakers\n\\1 = the speaker name\n740 Eclipse Help\nReplace: {C}DIRECT BY \\1 Results: {S:MR.

Let's say, for example, that you wanted to create a whole category\nof dictionary entries for all of your speakers for the start of direct examination.\nYou might want to turn STPHAO = {S:MR. SMITH} into TKREBGS STPHAO = {C}\nDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. SMITH\nSince this is a search/replace function, keep in mind that the original entry would\ndisappear, so you would first search for all of your speakers and COPY them to a\nseparate dictionary, then run a search as follows:\nSteno search: One-stroke entries Steno replace: TKREBGS \\1\nText search: Speakers Text replace: {C}DIRECT BY \\1\nResults: STPHAO = {S:MR. SMITH} --> TKREBGS STPHAO = {C}DIRECT BY MR.\nSMITH\n22.4.3 Search and replace on Steno and text\nIn the find function in dictionaries, the steno and text each have separate replace\nfields in which you can type a replacement for the original text. Since this dialog has\ntwo searches and two replacements, there may be some question about what this\nfeature does if one or more of them is blank.\nIf only the text or only the steno has content typed into both the search and\nreplace, the other part of the entry is ignored. For example, if you tell it to replace the\ntext \"{A:bold}\" with \"{b}\" it will do so for all entries, regardless of their steno.\nReference Guide 741\nIf both search boxes contain text, then only entries that match both of the search\ncriteria will be considered. In this case, if either of the replace boxes contain text, then\nthat text will be used to replace the appropriate matching portion of the entry. If both\nreplace boxes contain text, then that text will be replaced in both of the portions of the\nentry.\nHere are some examples (p.s. Do not use these examples as written. They all\nhave limitations and should not be used literally.)\nExample 1:\nSteno search: (ends with) S\nSteno replace: Z\nText search: (ends with) s\nThis search would find any entry that ends with -S in the steno and also ends\nwith \"s\" in the text and replaces the -S with -Z in the steno but leaves the text alone.\nThis is an example of how someone might change many entries in their dictionary to\nconform to a steno theory change.\nExample 2:\nSteno search: (custom)(\\w+)FPLT Steno replace: \\1RBGS\nText search: (custom)\\{&(\\w)\\}\nText replace: {&-\\1}\nThis search would find any entry where the steno is (something)FPLT =\n{&(oneletter)} and replace it with (something)RBGS = {&-(oneletter)} This could be\nused to create a stitching alphabet based on a spelling alphabet in one step (after\ncopying the first so that it could be pasted back in.) (Again, don't actually use this\nexample as written, because it won't catch every instance. It's only intended as a\ndemonstration of the fact that the search must match both and can replace both.)\nTwo further considerations:\nIt is possible that when searching and replacing the steno, you could end up\ncreating steno strokes that make no sense. Eclipse does NOT detect these, and will\nattempt to make the entry anyway, but the end result will always be sensible steno.\nEclipse will always ask you if you wish to make the replacement, so you will have a\nchance to review the entry.\nIf you specify a replacement that makes nonsense steno, Eclipse will be able to\ninterpret the steno right up to the point where it makes no sense, and ALL remaining\nkeys in the steno stroke will be removed from the stroke.\nFor example, if you decided that you had a series of entries such as STPHAO,\nSTPHAOEU, STPHA, STPHO and you wished to use them all with the right upper bank\ninstead of the left, it would be quite INCORRECT to do it like this:\nSearch: STPH\n742 Eclipse Help\nReplace -FPLT\nThe steno replace works just like a text replace on steno, so when you replace\nSTPH with\n-FPLT in the string\nSTPHAO\nyou will get\n-FPLTAO\nwhich makes no sense. Eclipse will attempt to parse that stroke, get as far as -\nFPLT, and that's as far as it will go because the A that comes after is in the wrong\nplace and cannot be interpreted. It will then attempt to store the entry with the steno\n-FPLT.\nThe correct way to do this search/replace would be a custom search that was\ncognizant of the location of the part of the steno you wanted to keep and repositioned\nit accordingly:\nSearch (custom): ^STPH([AOEU]+)$\nReplace: \\1FPLT\nIn the case of the previous bad example and often even in search/replace\ncommands that are correct, you can still end up with a problem if the replacement\nprocess creates steno that already exists. Fortunately, if you have User settings | Edit |\nDetect conflicts turned on, that problem has been addressed. When the steno is\nreplaced, it attempts to store the entry, and if it sees that the new steno happens to\nmatch an entry you already have it will show you that that steno is already used and\nwill ask you if you wish to replace the old entry with the new one. If you had detect\nconflicts off, and you ignored the replace message (or you answered \"all\" to a suspect\nsteno search/replace) you could, in fact, create problems in your dictionary.\nFortunately, you can hit the Undo command if you discover the problem in time.\n22.5 Dictionary statistics\nDictionary statistics\nIf you go to the Tools menu/Job report while in a dictionary, or rightclick\non a dictionary entry and choose Statistics, you will get a âPlease waitâ\ndialog for a moment, and then a Dictionary statistics window will appear with\ndetailed information about the dictionary.\nReference Guide 743\nThis window is zoomable, resizable, and scrollable so that you can see\nall of the information.\nIt will display how many entries in your dictionary match ALL of the\nsearch filters that exist in the programming tab for both steno and text,\nincluding any filters that you have personally added or modified, making the\nstatistics extremely customizable.\nNext to each of the descriptions it will show the actual number of\nentries in the dictionary that match that filter, followed by a bar representing\nthe percentage of the entire dictionary. The bar graph grows and shrinks to\nfit the size of the window.\n744 Eclipse Help\nThere is a print function that will print the statistics report. The\nprintouts will use the document top and left margin, and will include the\nname and date at the top of the first page.\n22.6 File Manager\nFile Manager\nEclipse utilizes a custom File manager that enables you to perform many\nfunctions including Copy to/Move to, Rename, Delete, Zip/Unzip, Backup/Restore,\nTranslate, Open, Print, Ascii, and Revert. It includes an Info box that lists statistics\nand other information (such as speaker names, and the name of the last person who\nedited it) about each file.\nTo open File manager in Eclipse, press Ctrl+F.\nReference Guide 745\nThe Job name list\nThe large window in the File manager contains the list of jobs. Each of your jobs\nwill appear, along with other information to help you work with them. If you have a\njob open, when you go into the file manager it will highlight the file you currently\nhave open.\nA âjobâ is simply any number of Eclipse-specific files that share the same name.\nA job may contain an .ECL file (transcript), .DIX (dictionary), .NOT (steno), .WAV\n(sound), . TXT (ASCII), .RTF (conversion), or any combination thereof.\nThe name of the job appears under the Job name heading. This is the name you\ngave the job when you created it.\nEach job has a plus sign to the left of its name. Clicking the plus sign will allow\nyou to view the individual components of that job:\n746 Eclipse Help\nThis job contains a note file, a text document, and a dictionary. The creation\ndate, last edit date, and size of each file are visible. You can click the minus sign to\ntake the details back out of view.\nReference Guide 747\nJob Info\nAt the bottom left of the Eclipse File Manager is a box\nthat gives you information about the currently selected job. It\nwill tell you the name, creation date, last edit date, size of the\nfile, speaker list entries, and job variables. It lists translation\nstatistics and the calculated statistics from the tools menu, as\nwell as other information that is stored, including the name of\nthe last person to edit the file, the name of the person who\ntranslated it, and the name of the scopist (the last person to\nopen it on an edit station.) For text files, you will also get the\nnumber of pages and the names of any job dictionaries that\nwere used. For dictionaries, you will be told the number of\nentries.\nThe information in this box is included in any search you\ndo using the Search function in the file manager. This allows\nyou to search for any job in the current folder that contains\nthe text you're searching for anywhere in the info that\nappears, so if you do a search for \"Frank\", for example, you\nwill find any job that contains \"Frank\" as a reporter, scopist,\nspeaker or name that appears among the job variables.\nAlso note that you can include the label in the search, so\nif you search for \"Scoped by: Bob\" it will find any job where\nthat specific text appears in the info pane, allowing you to\nnarrow your searches considerably.\nThe creation version is recorded separately from the\nversion that last edited the file. This information is visible in\nthe file manager.\nVoice users can find the name of the speech model that created a file here.\nSelecting locations:\nThe current path is shown at the bottom of the file manager window.\nThere are tabs at the top of the job list. Clicking on these tabs shows the\ncontents of the selected location in the job list. Each of these is a location where\nEclipse files can be stored. Clicking a tab will load the contents of that location into\nthe Jobs Area.\nJobs is your jobs folder, also known as your User Files Area. This is where the\nbulk of your work, including your main dictionary and any extra dictionaries, are\nstored.\nBlocks is your blocks folder. This is where your block files (title pages, list files,\netc.) are stored. By default this is the same as your Jobs folder; however, some\nreporters prefer to keep these in a separate folder.\nThe location of your Jobs and Blocks folder is defined in User Settings. Go to the\nUser tab, click the Advanced button, and you will have the opportunity to re-assign\nthese. The default location for both of these is:\nC:\\Program Files\\Advantage Software\\Eclipse\\Users\\Your Name\n748 Eclipse Help\nMany reporters create a sub-folder for their block files. Its path is: C:\\Program\nFiles\\Advantage Software\\Eclipse\\Users\\Your Name\\Blocks.\nThe Aux (Auxiliary) and Network tabs are file paths that can be set up in User\nsettings/User tab/Advanced button. Auxiliary is often used for an additional storage\nfolder, such as a CD-ROM drive. Network is most often used if the reporterâs computer\nis on a network. If you are using these extra file locations, you can access them in the\nEclipse File Manager by clicking their tabs.\nBackup will search the backup directory. This directory is created if you use the\nâa Backup directory on the hard driveâ option when doing Tools/Backup, or if you copy\nfiles to it in Eclipse File Manager. (Note that the Backup tab does not apply to backups\nthat are made using the Timed Auto Backup option on the Edit tab of User Settings. A\nlater section will describe how to access those.)\nThe Browse tab allows you to select any folder on your computer, and have its\ncontents appear in the Jobs Area. This allows you to examine a folder that is not\nselected as Jobs, Blocks, Auxiliary, or Network.\nThe gear button quickly takes you to the User tab of User Settings. Click\non the Advanced button to open the Advanced User Settings dialog, where\nyou can re-assign the Jobs, Blocks, Auxiliary, or Network path.\nNote: The Users location tab and copy/move destination can be used to make\nbackup copies, restore and delete .ini settings files.\nMoving around in File Manager\nYou can advance through the tabs using Ctrl+right arrow and Ctrl+left arrow or\njump to a particular tab using Ctrl+1 (or Alt+1 or Shift+1) through Ctrl+7.\nYou can scroll using the keyboard, mouse buttons, or mouse wheel.\nYou can type a letter to go to the first file that starts with a particular letter, or\nyou can type multiple keys to search for a filename. Hitting a letter after a onesecond\npause will indicate the start of a new file name.\nSummary\nThe file manager has a Summary button which generates a summary report for\nall of the marked jobs. If you have no jobs marked with a checkbox, it will generate a\nsummary for all of the jobs in the current folder. If you have any jobs expanded with\nthe plus sign, the report will contain additional details about the individual files in the\njob.\nReference Guide 749\nWhen you click the Summary button, an Open file dialog opens, with the\ndefault file name JobSummary.txt. You can use this name, or type in a different file\nname. Click Open, and answer Yes when the dialog asks if you want to create this\nfile. It will warn you if there is already a file with that name. Choose Yes to overwrite\nit, or No to go back and create it again with a new name. The file opens, and is\nautomatically saved in the Jobs folder. It is in ASCII format, and once it is created, it\nopens in notepad (or whatever text editor is your default), for printing or copying and\npasting into any other application, including Eclipse.\nThis report lists file names, file sizes, and most importantly, the number of\nbillable pages in each file. At the end of the report, it will show a total number of\npages for all of the files selected. (Note: The number of billable pages is a calculation\nthat is only in Eclipse 4, so older jobs will show a zero in the report.)\nBillable pages can be calculated automatically for any job that uses simple\nsequential page numbering (from 1 to the end page), taking the last page number in\nthe job as the number of billable pages. However, if a job contains ANY ânew page\nnumberâ commands that start a whole new page number at any point in the file, the\nlast page number cannot be used to calculate billable pages.\nIn this case, you must manually issue a command to cause the number of\nbillable pages to be recalculated. This command is Tools/Job report. That feature\nactually counts the total number of pages in the file, which it stores permanently in\nthe file. You can recalculate it at any time by executing Tools/Job report again.\nTo make older jobs work for this summary, simply open the old job and use\nCtrl+PgDn to jump to the end. Or, if the job contains new page number commands,\nuse the Tools/Job report function on these jobs before attempting to create the\nsummary report.\nSettings\nNext to the Summary button is a Settings.. button, which opens the Job\nmanager options dialog. The options have to do with the zipping(compression), and\ndeletion, of files.\n750 Eclipse Help\nThe Excluded from whole job ZIP area allows you to exclude certain types of\nfiles from the zipped version of the job. For example, you may wish to exclude .WAV\nfiles because of their size. To exclude a type of file, enter its extension into the\nExcluded from whole job ZIP text box:\nTo exclude more than one type of file, separate them with commas. The period\nis not necessary.\nThe Warning Level When Deleting option allows you to determine the level of\nprotection you have when deleting files.\nEach File is the highest level of protection. With this option active, you will be\nasked to confirm each file you wish to delete. A job can contain multiple files, so if\nyou try to delete a job that contains a .DIX, .ECL and .NOT file, you will be prompted\nthree times, one for each component.\nEach Job will prompt you once for the entire job, no matter how many\nindividual files it contains.\nReference Guide 751\nOnce At Beginning will only prompt you once when you being the deletion\nprocess, no matter how many jobs you are deleting at once.\nAs the name implies, Never warn will not warn you at all when deleting.\nIf you accidentally delete a file, it can be retrieved from the Recycle Bin in\nWindows. In brief, you will double-click the Recycle Bin on your desktop; right-click\nthe file you wish to retrieve; and then select Restore File(s). See Windows Help for\nfurther explanation of this process.\nSelecting files:\nYou can select files with the mouse or the keyboard. To select multiple files, click\nthe box next to the file to check it, or hit the space bar. If you do not check any files,\nthen when you execute a function it is assumed that you wish to execute the function\non the currently highlighted file. It will only perform the function on the highlighted\nfile if no files are checked. You can use Shift+Click on the checkboxes to select or deselect\nmultiple files.\nIf you wish to show the files in a different order, click on the Job name or\nCreated or Edited headings above the columns. That will sort them in alphabetical\norder or by date. Clicking on the same button again will reverse the order of the items\nin the list. You can also use the hotkeys, F2, F3 and F4 keys to sort the files and jobs\nby Job name, Created, and Edited.\nWhen you first examine a folder, the software will list the job names. Each job\nmay contain a number of different files. The different files will be indicated by icons to\nthe right of the created and edited dates. If you click the plus sign next to the job\nname, all of the individual files will be listed.\nIf you select an entire job, the system assumes that you wish to perform an\noperation (such as rename or copy) on ALL of the files within the job. If you expand\nthe job with the plus sign and select individual files, the operation will be performed\nONLY on the files you select.\nNote: If you use the mouse to click directly on the icons, you can select\nindividual files without expanding the view. Note that only the selected files will be\nhighlighted in that case.\nThere is an information pane on the left side under the function buttons. This\ncontains detailed information about the currently highlighted job, including the job\nvariables from the transcript. If you wish to search for any information, from the file\nname to the job variables to the dates, just select the âSearchâ function and type in\nwhat you're searching for.\nAvailable functions:\nNote that each of the following functions can be accessed using either Alt+letter\nor Ctrl+letter or Shift+letter where letter is the underlined letter. Also, you can rightclick\nthe file name, which brings up a context-sensitive list of the functions.\nWhen copying files in the Eclipse file manager, files must be closed since\nWindows cannot copy files while they're opened and being worked on. If job files,\nnote files, dictionaries and wave files are open, the file manager will ask if you want to\nautomatically close them.\n752 Eclipse Help\nCopy/Move to destination. If you select the copy or move buttons, the\nselected files will be copied or moved to the selected destination. If you have âPrompt\nfor destinationâ selected, you will be asked where you wish to send the files. You can\nalso pre-select the location so that you can perform multiple copy/move operations\nwithout having to keep answering the prompt.\nIf you Copy a file to the current folder, it will prompt you for a new jobname,\nwhich will apply to all of the job's files at once. This gives you an easy way to make a\nduplicate of a file or job.\nNote that if you select the backup folder, it will automatically create a folder\nnamed âEclipse backupsâ if you do not already have one.\nIf you select email, you can mark any number of files and use the copy or move\nfunction to send them. Note that it will always attach all of the files marked to a\nsingle e-mail, so if you need to send individual files to different recipients, you will\nneed to send them separately. The subject line of the e-mail and the default body text\nof the e-mail are user-definable using the file manager Settings button which opens\nthe Job manager options dialog.\nIf you select Burn to CD, and you use Windows XP, you can burn files directly\nto a CD as you would to a floppy disk. Select the files you want to burn, click Copy\nto..,.select Burn to CD as your destination and the files will be burned.\nIt can burn additional information on CDs that already have files on them, and it\ncan also burn CD-RW disks. If you burn on a CD-RW, it will ask if you wish to erase\nthe contents of the disk first.\nRename. This will rename all of the selected files. If several files are part of the\nsame job, it will only ask you if you want to rename them once and will rename all of\nthe files at once.\nDelete. This will display a warning message, âAre you sure you wish to move\nselected parts of filename to the recycle bin?â and will move all of the selected files to\nthe recycle bin. The Settings button allows you to select how often the system will\nask you if you're sure you wish to delete the selected files. Note that you will have to\nperiodically empty your recycle bin to actually eliminate the files from your hard drive.\nReference Guide 753\nNote that if you are deleting files from an external drive, the files will be\npermanently deleted, not sent to the recycle bin. The warning message will state âAre\nyou sure you wish to delete selected parts of filename permanently?â\nZip/Unzip. These functions will compress and decompress the files for more\nefficient storage and/or e-mailing. Zipping a job allows for easier emailing, and makes\nthe files take less space on your hard drive or storage media.\nWhen you zip a job, the .ZIP file will appear as a file within the job:\nThe .ZIP file can then be independently copied, emailed, etc. as described\nherein.\nThe Settings button has a line where you can type in specific file extensions that\nshould be excluded from zip files, such as WAV files which are generally too large to\nefficiently store and would take a very long time to ZIP (not to mention that they\nwouldn't compress at all if you're already using a compressed audio format.)\nBackup/Restore. You can select multiple files in the file manager and select\nthe backup function, choosing the location in which the zip file will be saved.\n754 Eclipse Help\nReference Guide 755\nWhen you select restore, it runs the restore wizard so that you can select the\nfiles from a backup. A Browse function is included, so you can choose any location\nfrom which to restore your backup files.\nWhen you use the file manager to backup and restore your files, the files are\nautomatically zipped when backing up and unzipped when restoring.\nTranslate/Open/Print/ASCII. These functions are the same as if you were\nexecuting the function from within Eclipse. One special note: The Open and Print\nfunctions assume that you wish to work with the transcript. If you expand the job\nwith the plus sign and select a specific file (such as an ASCII or HTML file), or click on\nan icon to the right of the job name, it will open that file specifically. If you select a\ndocument that has no .ecl file, the open or print command will execute on that\ndocument. However, if you click on a job that does not contain an .ecl file, and you do\nnot select a particular file by clicking on the icon, you must fan out the job to open or\nprint the files. When you Open a file, the File manager window closes. If you select\none or more files and press the ASCII button, you will not only get ASCII files for\neach of the documents in your jobs folder, but you will also get copies in the folder\nyou have specified for ASCII copies. Note that this copying only takes place if the\nsecondary location is a folder on your hard drive, and if you have previously created\nan ASCII file and selected the Make [1] copies option in the ASCII dialog with a\nnumber other than zero.\n756 Eclipse Help\nRevert. The Revert button has to do with the Timed auto-backup feature on the\nEdit tab of User settings. If are using Timed auto-backup (which is activated by\nsetting it to a number of minutes greater than zero), Eclipse will create a series of\nbackup files, as frequently as you specify, named jobname.bk0, jobname.bk1,\njobname.bk2, etc. up to jobname.bk9. When you press the Revert button, it displays\na list of all of the backup files for the current job. The one you select will be copied\nover the Jobname.ecl in the jobs folder. Note that this does NOT save the original\nJobname.ecl file anywhere. You should NOT use Revert unless the current version of\nthe file is unsalvageable.\nThe files are saved in the backup folder, which by default is â\\Eclipse backups.â\nYou can change the location of the backup folder in User settings/Programming/File\nlocations/BACKUP=. The .bk files are copies of the .ECL transcript file that can be\nreverted to in the event of a catastrophic error. This is what the Revert button does; it\nswitches back to the previously saved version of the job, allowing you to switch to a\nversion of the job that predates the error. The next time you open the .ECL file, it will\nbe the older, reverted-to version.\nHaving a series of backup files will allow you to go back to an even older version\nof the file if the most recent backup contains an error that you were trying to recover\nfrom (such as a disastrous block-delete or ill-advised text global.) If you have your\nbackup interval set to 30 minutes, for example, it will keep the last five hours worth\nof backups.\nProperties. This runs the properties dialog from Windows Explorer. Note that if\nyou select a whole job, the properties of all of the files will be opened at the same\ntime.\nYou can protect a file from being overwritten by making it read-only. In the file\nmanager, select the file, hit the Properties button, then check or uncheck the \"readonly\"\nflag and hit OK. If you attempt to edit a file which has been set to \"read only,\"\nEclipse will remind you that you cannot make edits to the file until the flag is\nunchecked.\nSearch. Clicking the Search button allows you to search for a file, by any criteria\nyou like.\nYou can search for a file by date, name, size, number of entries, number of\npages â any criteria that appears in the Job Stats box. Simply type the search criteria\ninto the search box and press Enter. The first job that matches the criteria will be\nhighlighted. You will also be able to see the Job Stats for that job.\nReference Guide 757\nIf this isnât the job you want, repeat the search. It will stop on the next job that\nmatches the search criteria. The fastest way to repeat a search is to press Alt+S and\nthen Enter.\nWhen you perform a search, it will search from the currently selected file down.\nIf you want to search the entire directory, you need to make sure the first file is\nselected before you begin the search. To do this, press Home before beginning a\nsearch. Home moves the selection to the first file in the list.\nEject drive allows you to automatically eject the currently selected drive from\nthe file manager. Click on a drive tab set in file locations or use browse to browse for a\ndrive to eject it. .\nFile Destination\nWhen copying or moving files, you need to select where you want them to go.\nSelect the desired file destination in the drop-down list that appears to the right of\nthe Copy To and Move To buttons.\n758 Eclipse Help\nMost of these choices are the same as the tabs: Jobs, Blocks, email, CD, Backup,\nAuxiliary, Network, and Browse.\nThe E-Mail option will open your e-mail program and attach the selected job to\na message.\nWhen you select a file destination, that destination will be remembered in your\nUser Settings, and future file actions will default to that destination each time. If you\nare frequently moving files to the same location, it is useful to select that destination\nin the drop-down list.\nAlternatively, the Prompt For Destination option will ask you to Pick where\nyou want to move or copy the job each time:\nAlso there are several functions that do not appear anywhere on the file\nmanager screen: Ctrl+W will open the user settings; and Ctrl+F will open explorer as\nwill Ctrl+E (so, to get to Windows explorer from Eclipse directly, hit Ctrl+F twice).\nThe F2, F3 and F4 keys are used to sort the files and jobs by Job name, date\nCreated and date last modified (Edited).\nVisualizers:\nJ1 - File Manager\nJ1 - File Manager Navigation\nJ1a - File Info\nJ1a - File Search\nJ1b - Auxiliary Folder\nJ1b - Copy/Move File\nJ1b - Destination Prompt\nReference Guide 759\nJ1c - Delete/Recover File\nJ1c - Recycle Bin\nJ3 - Backup Work Files\nJ1b - CD Burn\nJ1b - E-mail\n22.7 Glue characters\nGlue characters\nA glue alphabet is a set of letters that can be used to construct\nacronyms, stitched words, or fingerspell unexpected words.\nMost steno theories include one set of letters, with steno A-FPLT for A,\nPW-FPLT for B, etc. through STK-FPLT for Z. In Eclipse, these are defined as\nfollows:\n760 Eclipse Help\nThat is, {&X}, where X is the letter for this particular entry. You would\nhave a complete set of {&A}, {&B}, {&C}, etc. through {&Z}.\nGlue entries stick to each other and not anything else. The glue\ncharacters will not attach to the word following or preceding. So you donât\nneed different entries for characters that begin or end a string.\nReference Guide 761\nWhen mixed glue symbols are written next to each other, the stitching\nwill take precedence over the non-stitched letters, whether the stitched one\nis written first or second. For example, either {&-A}{&B} or {&A}{&-B}\ntranslates A-B.\nYou do not need glue entries for numbers. If you check Glue Numbers\non the Numbers tab of User Settings, numbers will automatically behave as\nglue characters when written in conjunction with glue characters. This allows\nyou to write alphanumeric combinations like license plate numbers. If you\nprefer, there is an option for not sticking to numbers â see page 139.\nGlue entries are also known as Alphabets, Spelling Alphabets,\nAbbreviation Alphabets, or Stitching Alphabets. Some examples of their use\nare:\nthe {&F} {&B} {&I} agent translates as the FBI agent\n{&-J {&-O} {&-N} translates as J-O-N\n{&U.} {&S.} translates as U.S.\n27 {&(e)} {&(a) translates as 27(e)(a)\nThe FBI entry above is an example of a capitalized acronym. If you\nwant the ability to write lower-case glue letters, and/or to write words that\nare separated by periods or dashes, you will need additional dictionary\nentries. To handle separation and capitalization with glue characters, you\nmay use glue templates, or have separate alphabets for each manner of\nseparation. Glue templates can be used to streamline the functioning of your\nglue entries, eliminating the need for multiple Alphabets.\nGlue Templates\nIn your main dictionary, you define a single glue alphabet: {&A}, {&B},\n{&C}, etc. Normally, those can be used for FBI, IBM, CIA, etc. Now, if you\nwant to stitch a series of letters like J-O-H-N, it was previously necessary to\ncreate a second alphabet: {&-A}, {&-B}, {&-C}, etc. With glue templates,\nyou can write a stroke on the writer which instantly applies a special\ntemplate to all glue entries that follow, until you write a non-glue symbol.\nIt uses the existing syntax and allows you to specify a wildcard character (*)\nto indicate where the previous glue text goes in the template.\nFor example, if you write a dictionary entry like this: {&-*} that means\nchange ALL glue entries from this point forward. So when you write {&A} it\nwill change to {&-A} automatically.\nYou can write a glue template entry before you write the glue symbols\nthemselves, and the template will remain in effect until you write some glue\nentries. The glue template will only be deactivated when you write non-glue\nentries.\nNote that this allows you to attach a glue template to another dictionary\nentry such as \"spell{&-*}\" so that you would get\n762 Eclipse Help\nQ. How do you spell your name?\nA. It's J-O-N with no H.\nGlue templates last only as long as you continue to write glue symbols. As\nsoon as you write something which is not a glue symbol, the glue template\nwill turn off.\nHere are some examples of other glue templates you might use: {&*.} (for\nabbreviations with periods) {&* } (for putting a space between each letter)\n{&(*)} (for putting each letter in parens for things like Section 27(A)(G))\nSo as long as you use the template strokes, you only need one alphabet, and\nusing a template feature like this instead of hard-coding a certain number of\npre-defined types of glue alphabet formats means that the applications for\nthis feature are limited only by your imagination.\nUsing glue templates to specify capitalization\nIf you put a pipe | character anywhere in the glue template, it will force the\nletters to capitalize. This will allow you to create a single alphabet in **lowercase**\nletters such as {&a} {&b} {&c} {&d} etc., and you can use\ntemplates to determine how they will capitalize as well as what other\ncharacters will appear around them.\nExamples:\n{&*} {&a} {&b} {&c} becomes abc\n{&-*} {&a} {&b} {&c} becomes a-b-c\n{&(*)} {&a} {&b} {&c} becomes (a)(b)(c)\n{&|*} {&a} {&b} {&c} becomes ABC\n{&|-*} {&a} {&b} {&c} becomes A-B-C\n{&|(*)} {&a} {&b} {&c} becomes (A)(B)(C)\nTrick: {&*}{|} {&a} {&b} {&c} becomes Abc\nThe < symbol can be used to lower-case a glue alphabet.\nFor example, if your glue alphabet is\n{&A} {&B} {&C}\nthen\n{&*<}{&A}{&B}{&C} becomes abc.\nBelow is a summary of the various glue templates:\nTEMPLATE MEANING RESULT OF FOLLOWINGWITH {&A}\n{&B}{&C}\nReference Guide 763\n{&*} No separation ABC\n{&-*} Stitch with dashes A-B-C\n{&*.} Stitch with periods A.B.C.\n{&(*)} Place in parentheses A)(B)(C)\nTEMPLATE MEANING RESULT OF FOLLOWINGWITH {&a}{&b}\n{&c}\n{&*} No separation, no capitalization abc\n{&|*} No separation, capitalized ABC\n{&*}{|} No separation, initial cap Abc\n{&-*} Stitch with dashes, no cap a-b-c\n{&|-*} Stitch with dashes, cap A-B-C\n{&-*}{|} Stitch with dashes, initial cap A-b-c\n{&|*.} Stitch with periods, cap A.B.C.\n{&|(*)} Place in parens, cap (A)(B)(C)\n{&}(*)} Place in parens, no cap (a)(b)(c)\nNote that the period goes after the asterisks, but the dash goes before. This\nis because we want a period after the last letter in the series (A.B.C.) but we\ndo not want a dash after the last letter (A-B-C).\nSeparation and capitalization with multiple alphabets\nAn alternate approach is to use separate alphabets for each possible method\nof capitalization and/or separation. The drawback to this approach is that you\nwill need different ways of writing the different alphabets.\nFor example, A-FPLT would be a capital A, while A-RBGS would be a lower\ncase a. You would define these as {&A} and {&a} respectively, and create a\ncomplete alphabet for each. Writing O-FPLT/H-RBGS/EU-RBGS/O-RBGS\nwould give you âOhioâ.\nSimilarly, you would make additional alphabets that include separation\ncharacters, and assign them different steno strokes.\nTo define glue alphabets with a separator:\nFor glue characters separated by a hyphen, define them as {&-A} through\n{&-Z}.\nWriting {&-S}{&-M}{&-I}{&-T}{&-H} would give you S-M-I-T-H with no\ntrailing hyphen.\nFor glue characters separated by a period, defined them as {&A.} through\n{&Z.}\nWriting {&U.}{&S.}{&M.}{&C.} would give you U.S.M.C. with a trailing\nperiod.\n764 Eclipse Help\nAs noted above, the period goes after the letter, but the dash goes before.\nThis is because we want a period after the last letter in the series (A.B.C.)\nbut we do not want a dash after the last letter (A-B-C).\nIf you need upper- and lower-case versions of each of the possible methods\nof separation, you will need at least five different alphabets, at 26 letters\neach, and unique ways to write them.\n22.8 Hidden Text\nHidden Text\nShift+Alt+F7\nOn the Tools menu the Hidden text option (Shift+Alt+F7) opens a dialog\nwhich shows all the hidden characters in the current paragraph. This is\nprimarily a tool for software testing and technical support.\nYou can use the Find function (F5) to search for hidden text or hidden\ncharacters.\nThe hidden characters are rather cryptic, and most times you don't need to\nlook at them. However, there are times when it could be useful to be able to\nfind a particular sequence of hidden characters.\nYou can find hidden characters by using the same syntax that is used in the\nhidden text dialog, such as <2>.\nHere are the hidden character codes:\n<1> indicates a steno stroke for the purpose of steno tracking\n<2> indicates a font change\n<3> indicates a change of text type\n<16> lockspace\n<17> tab\n<21> literal-case on\n<22> literal-case off\nThe values 9-15 are reserved for storing values that follow the first three\ncommands (steno/font/type). For steno, it indicates the number of strokes.\nFor the font, it indicates the font number. For the text type, each number\nrepresents a different type of text.\nHere are what the values mean, with the text type given in parentheses.\nNote that you use these in conjunction with the other hidden characters. For\nexample, searching for <3><11> would search for a user-selected conflict,\nReference Guide 765\nand <2><14> would search for a font change to font number 6 (found in the\nUser settings/Document/Advanced/Master font table.)\n<9> - 1 (untran)\n<10> - 2 (unselected conflict)\n<11> - 3 (user-selected conflict)\n<12> - 4 (computer-selected conflict)\n<13> - 5 (typed-in text)\n<14> - 6 (scopist text)\n<15> - 7 (automatic punctuation text)\n<8><9> - 8 (form field)\n<9><9> - 9 (redacted)\n<10><9> - 10\n<11><9> - 11\n<12><9> - 12\n<13><9> - 13\n<14><9> - 14\n<15><9> - 15\n<8><10> - 16\nyou can calculate larger values thusly:\n<8-15><10> - 16-23\n<8-15><11> - 24-31\n<8-15><12> - 32-39\netc.\nFor example, if you had a long font list, and you wanted to search for a font\nchange where the text was being changed to font number 29, that would be\n<2><13><11>\n766 Eclipse Help\n22.9 International Options\nInternational Options\nSetting Up Eclipse for use with other languages\nIf you are setting up Eclipse to run in a language other than English,\nfirst set up a user by importing the settings files appropriate for your\nlanguage. For each language, there is a LanguageName.set file that must be\nimported and a LanguageName.dat file that must be copied over the\nwordpart.dat file in order for the grammar rules to take effect. You may need\nto change settings in the ini file, finding the Language= line and changing it\nto Language=12 (French) or Language=16 (Italian) The setting for English is\nLanguage=9. The settings files are in the Eclipse folder, or are available on\nthe Advantage Software website, or from ASI support.\nKeyboards\nThe universal steno keyboards described in the Reference Guide\nshow the letters on the keys, and reflect different letter assignments for\ndifferent languages. This dialog is capable of displaying the Treal, the\nGemini, the Continental, Grandjean, the Italian Michela and the UK Palantype\nkeyboards as well as Spanish, extended Spanish, and Hebrew. Some\nadditional keyboard functions for specific languages are described in the\nindividual language sections which follow.\nNote that if you select the Hebrew keyboard layout, the keyboard\ncharacters will not change to Hebrew characters unless you have the Hebrew\nversion of Windows installed. If you have regular Windows installed you will\nsee a series of accented western language letters.\nLockspaces and @ characters\nIf you are using UK or non-English language keyboards, and have had\ntrouble with the @ sign or the tilde, you can remove the command in the\nkeyboard settings for inserting a lockspace and replace it with your keystroke\nfor the ~ character. You can then add both lockspaces and @ characters.\nSelecting dictionaries to use for spell checking\nTo select the spelling dictionary appropriate for your language, go to\nUser settings/Edit tab, Spell options, click on the Spellings button and\nselect the dictionary you prefer.\nRTF import\n893\nReference Guide 767\nThe RTF/CRE dictionary standard only supports English steno, so non-\nEnglish language dictionaries will import the steno as English and convert it\nto the native language.\nImporting a document in RTF will recognize the codes for extended\ncharacters, so foreign language accent marks will convert to match the\noriginal document.\nNumber conversion options\nIf you use something other than a comma as the delimiter character,\nclick the Vocabulary setup button. In the Thousands symbol field,\nenter the character you want to use as the delimiter. (U.S. traditionally uses\na comma whereas in Europe a period is often used.)\nEclipse will allow âhundredâ to mean âone hundredâ and âthousandâ to\nmean âone thousandâ in French. For example, in French, âdeux cent troisâ\nwould be 203. However, âcent troisâ would be 103. French speakers typically\ndo not say the âoneâ (or âunâ) before the âcentâ (hundred.). The number\nconversion takes that into account and assumes that if an order of magnitude\nword appears with no number before it, it will act as though a â1â was\nwritten before it.\nNote that numbers such as onziÃ©me and zÃ©ro which include accented\ncharacters will be recognized by the number conversion procedures.\nIntegral prefix/suffix handler\nThe integral prefixes and suffixes will work for steno languages other\nthan standard English, and will take advantage of Palantype keyboards,\nGrandjean, German, Italian, Michela, etc.\nNon-English Translation Magic phonetics\nPhonetics tables are being updated to allow French and Italian versions\nto work with Translation Magic. There will be further updates as user update\nthe settings.\nFrench\nContinental (French) and Extended Continental Keyboard\nlayout\nThe shape and layout of the keys on the Treal machine are set up so\nthat it can mimic the Continental Grandjean keyboard. The extended French\nkeyboard layout for the Treal is identical to the Grandjean layout, and\nincludes a number of other keys including the number keys and special\nsymbols inserted for the vowel keys (since the vowels on a Grandjean\nkeyboard are on the main key rows for the right hand.)\n821\n768 Eclipse Help\nFrench spelling and grammar\nIn order to activate the French grammar rules, you have to edit your\n.ini file manually since there is no user option in the software to change the\nlanguage. You must find the Language= line in the .ini file and change it to\nLanguage=12.\nThe rules that are applied are as follows:\nÂ· A plural determinant will pluralize the next noun and any adjectives that\ngo with it.\nÂ· A plural pronoun will pluralize the next verb that appears in the\nsentence. If the verb ends in âeâ or âaitâ it will change to âentâ or\nâaient.â\nÂ· A verb or preposition will force the following verb in the sentence into its\ninfinitive form if it ends in âÃ©â by changing it to âer.â\nÂ· A pronoun will force the following verb into an appropriate spelling if it\nends in t, d, c, i or u. The software will add âsâ or âtâ as appropriate.\nÂ· For verbs ending in i, a, u or Ã©, the system can apply âesâ âsâ or âeâ to\nturn it into a past participle. However, in order to do that, the phrases that\ntrigger past participles have to be identified in the metadictionary and MUST be\ndefined as phrases in the main dictionary.\no text1={/â%/?FRS} (indicates that âtext1â is a singular phrase indicating past\nparticiple.)\no text2={/â%/?FRP} (indicates that âtext2â is a plural phrase indicating past\nparticiple.)\no text3={/â%/?FRF} (indicates that âtext3â is a first person plural phrase\nindicating past participle.)\nNote: you should NOT include the pronoun in the phrase. For example,\nonly include âsont Ã©tÃ©â and do NOT include âelles sont Ã©tÃ©.â\nA comprehensive list of these phrases and other French-related settings\nare available in a French.set file.\nBe aware that if the grammar checker goes back and makes a\ncorrection to a piece of text, that text will then be registered as typed-in text\nand cannot be globalled.\nSome French spelling variation rules are in effect in Eclipse. For\nexample, it will do things like automatically turn âpommeâ into âpommesâ\nwhen preceded by âles.â\nSince there is no French definitions dictionary, the definition function\nshows grammar parts when French is the chosen language If you hit Alt+S\nand Alt+S on a French word and then select Alt+D for definitions, you will\nget a description of the grammar data for that word.\nReference Guide 769\nThe French wordpart.dat file allows the conflict resolution feature to work for\nthe French language. It contains a very complete description of the grammar\nof the French language including almost 300,000 words and their\nparts of speech, gender and tense.\nA French vocabulary Python plugin has also been added in Eclipse 11 to\nassist with even better French translation.\nAbbreviation conflict handler\nThe French abbreviation conflict handler takes advantage of the English\n\\a\\an resolution engine. This engine simply selects the first choice if the\nfollowing word starts with a consonant and selects the second choice if the\nfollowing word starts with a vowel.\nThis algorithm also applies to \\au\\aux, and any conflict where the first\nchoice ends in âaâ or âeâ and the second choice ends in '^}. For examples,\n\\la\\{l'^}, \\le\\{l'^}, \\de\\{d'^}, etc.\nFrench abbreviations are ignored by the spelling checker, so\nconstructions like âl'avionâ will be checked against the spelling dictionary as\njust âavionâ instead.\nPrefix and suffix exceptions in French\nPrefixes containing an apostrophe, such as {l'^} or {d'^} (used\nextensively in the French language) do not lower case the next word.\nEclipseâs suffix handler has been adjusted so that it will apply properly\nto words containing accented characters.\nGerman\nTreal keyboard\nGerman users of the Treal writer will find an extended keyboard layout\nfor German that supports the extra keys on the Treal keyboard.\nThe layout is as follows:\n# 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0\n^ S B G R ~ R M G S N\n| S T D L * L B D T E\nA U Y O I\nHere are the complete keyboard layouts in steno order as a string of data:\nGerman: #^|1S2BT3GD4RLAU5~*YOI6RL7MB8GD9ST0NE\n770 Eclipse Help\nNote that the separate number keys are, in fact, not treated as a number bar.\nEach is a separate key and will generate a number by itself. The number bar\nâshiftâ mechanism is completely disabled when using this extended layout.\nItalian\nEclipse includes a MIDI interface for Michela writer conversions. Since the\nMichela machines are getting more and more difficult to obtain, it is possible\nto substitute an actual musical MIDI keyboard in its place.\nThe option on the writer list is MIDI Michela. It works best with the Oxygen\nUSB MIDI keyboard from Midiman, which can be self-powered from the USB\nport on a laptop.\n22.10 Keyboard shortcuts, Hyperkeys, Toolbar buttons, Cursor\nmovement\nKeyboard shortcuts, Hyperkeys, and Toolbar button\nThese help pages contain charts of all the default Keyboard shortcuts ,\nhyperkeys , cursor movement , and toolbar buttons .\nAll are customizable. You can modify the functions assigned to hyperkeys and\nstandard keys.\nTo access keyboard editing controls, go to User settings (Alt+U) and the\nEdit tab.\nFrom the Edit tab, click the Keyboard button. The Keyboard definitions\nwindow appears listing the keyboard assignments for the selected keyboard.\nMark the Standard radio button if you want to alter a key assignment on the\nstandard keyboard, or mark the Hyperkeys radio button if you want to alter\na key assignment for your Hyperkeys. (By default, the list will show\nwhichever keyboard setting you are using; if you were using Hyperkeys, the\nHyperkey assignments will be in the list.)\nTo change the shortcut keys assigned to an item:\n1. In the display area, find and click on the item whose key assignment\nyou want to change.\n2. Select the Modify button. The Keyboard command dialog appears,\nwith the selected item shown in the Command field.\n3. Click in the Keystroke field. Type the new key or key combination you\nwant to assign to the item. You can assign any combination of the\nCtrl, Alt, and Shift keys, plus one character key. To assign a\n772\n777 791 788\nReference Guide 771\ncombination, you must simultaneously hold down all keys in the\ncombination. If you want to remove the key assignment for an item\ncompletely, do not type any keys in this field.\nWARNING: Use care when assigning keys. If you select a combination that\nis already assigned to another item, the new assignment overwrites the\noriginal. For example, if you assign the J key to the âPlay back recordingâ\nfunction, the J key will no longer type the letter âj,â when pressed.\n4. Select OK. The Keyboard definitions dialog again becomes active.\nThe modified key assignment will appear in the display area for the\nappropriate keyboard (standard or Hyperkeys).\nTo remove an item from the lists of standard keyboard\nor Hyperkey assignments:\n1. In the display area of the Keyboard definitions window, find and\nclick on the item you want to remove.\n2. Select the Delete button. The item is removed from the list and the\nkey assignment no longer calls the function. (Note: some key\nassignments cannot be deleted since they are standard Windows\nassignments. Examples are Alt+X for exit, Ctrl+C for copy, Delete for\ndelete. For example, if you delete the âDeleteâ key, and then close\nEclipse, the Delete key will be back in the list the next time you open\nEclipse. What you will need to do is select that key and use the\nModify button to assign a different command to it.)\nSpacebar commands â To turn the space bar (Space)\ninto a Ctrl key:\nSince most notebook computers come with only one Ctrl key that is not\nalways positioned ideally, Eclipse allows you to turn the space bar (Space)\ninto a Ctrl key, making editing easier. In User Settings | Edit mark the\nSpacebar commands checkbox. If space bar commands are activated, the\nspace bar needs to be the first key pressed and the last key released.\nNote: You can re-define the spacebar using the drop-down list in the key\nredefinition dialog. For this to be effective, you must turn off the âSpacebar\ncommandsâ option, which takes over the spacebar completely.\nFor more details on customization, see these help pages:\nCustomize toolbars , Keyboard (standard and hyperkey) 951 definitions 1008 ,\n772 Eclipse Help\n22.10.1 Keyboard shortcuts for Menu items\nKeyboard shortcuts for Menu items\nNote that, in keeping with accepted Windows conventions, capital\nletters always denote keys, not case.

They do not mean\nthat you must type the capital letter. Earlier versions of Eclipse referred to\nHyperkeys as lower-case and upper-case letters (A, a, B, b, etc.). That is not\nthe case with Eclipse.\n683\n31\n778 Eclipse Help\nYou can change the keyboard definitions for the Hyperkeys, but you\nshould do so only if necessary.

For example, you could create a lesson that focuses on final-side keys, or\non any aspect of steno shorthand you wish to focus on.\nThe easiest way to create a custom lesson is:\n1. Create a blank note file .\n2. Use the Ctrl+D command to add the desired steno strokes to the note\nfile .\n3. Translate the note file. This will produce a text file, as usual.\n4. Use the Install Lesson command to install the .ECL file.\nLesson Codes\nWhen creating a lesson, you may include a script command that controls the\nbehavior of the lesson. For example, you could make a lesson timed or un-timed; you\ncan show or obscure the steno emulator; or you can show only words and force the\nstudent to come up with the correct steno.\nTo control the behavior of a lesson, insert a Script Command at the\nbeginning of the .ECL file. Then, type one or more of the following codes into the\nscript command:\nÂ· TEXT - this command indicates that this is a test of text, and not of steno theory.\nÂ· U=Name - will load the user named \"Name\" before beginning the lesson. This\nallows you to create lessons that utilize particular user options.\nÂ· NOM - will remove the steno emulator.\nÂ· NOS - will remove the steno. The student will only see the text, and will have to\nwork out the correct steno.\nÂ· S=-1 - displays one word at a time, and asks the user to write it.\nÂ· S=0 - works like S=-1, except that each new word is added to the end of the file,\nlike a regular translation\nÂ· S=X - creates a speed drill where X is the number of words that will appear per\nminute. For example, a setting of S=120 would create a lesson where the words\nwould appear at a rate of 120 words per minute. If the student does not keep up,\nthey will fall behind.\nTo use multiple codes for one lesson, separate them with a pipe symbol. For\nexample, the following script command would show the words at a rate of 90 per\nminute, and will show the steno, but not the steno emulator:\n1002\n1010\n694\n1036 224\n224\n269\n1002\n367\n108\nReference Guide 793\nOnly one S code may be used, but otherwise the codes may be used in any\ncombination.\nInstalling A Lesson\nTo install a lesson, select Install Lesson from the Support menu. Then, select\nthe file you wish to install from the file dialog . The file you select will be copied to\nthe Lessons folder.\nThe Lessons folder is a subfolder of your Jobs folder . When you use the\nLesson Player command to play a lesson, this is the only place it will look. So you\nmust install the lesson, before it can be played.\nPlaying A Lesson\nTo play a lesson, select Lesson Player from the Support menu. Eclipse will\nattempt to establish a realtime connection with a steno machine; if this succeeds, the\nLesson Player dialog will appear. Click Start to begin the lesson.\n(Note that you can adjust the font for Lesson Player in two ways. First, it follows\nthe Windows scaling setting, making it work better for high-resolution displays, and\nsecondly, it follows the zoom level last set for the lesson player dialog globally This\nadjustment is not made dynamically since the lesson player does not user the\nstandard user interface font, so it may be necessary to zoom the lesson player and\nthen close and re-open the dialog for the font to change.)\nYou will be asked to enter strokes one at a time; if you make a mistake, you'll be\nasked to use the delete stroke to erase it, and then re-write it. If you write the steno\nstroke correctly, you'll move to the next stroke.\nAfter you have written the steno outlines in the lesson, the Lesson Score window\nwill appear, showing your statistics for the lesson.\nViewing Results\nWhen you take a lesson, a file called FILENAMEResults.TXT is created in the\nLessons folder. FILENAME is the name of the lesson file; for example, if you use a\nlesson called Lesson1.ecl, your results file would be Lesson1Results.txt.\nThis file contains a columnar list of statistics:\nÂ· Crect: correct strokes\nÂ· Incrt: incorrect strokes\nÂ· CWords: correct words\nÂ· ToWrd: total number of words in the lesson\nÂ· Dletd: number of deleted strokes\nÂ· Rpeat: number of strokes that were repeated (not including strokes that were\ndeleted and rewritten)\nÂ· Skips: number of strokes skipped (in a speed test)\nÂ· JumpF: number of times the student jumped forward in the file\n1002\n969\n905\n1010\n1010\n794 Eclipse Help\nÂ· JumpB: number of times the student jumped back in the file\nÂ· usWPM: user's words-per-minute rate\nÂ· toWPM: designated words-per-minute rate of the file\nÂ· Accrt: accuracy rate\nIf you take the same lesson multiple times, this file will contain a different entry\nfor each time you took the lesson. This allows you to track progress.\nVISUALIZERS:\nL3 - Lesson Player (for Teachers)\nL3a - Lesson Player (for Students)\nHow to Use the Editing Tutorial\n22.11.1 Lesson Player: Creating Lessons for School Use\nLesson Player: Creating Lessons for School Use\nThe Support menu/Lesson player is designed for playing and practicing the\ntutorial lessons that are installed with Eclipse. In addition, Teachers in\nschools can create customized lessons to help teach steno theory to students.\nInstructions for teachers preparing lessons for students are the subject of\nthis help file.\nWhen you select Lesson player from the Support menu, the Open file\nmenu appears, listing the .ecl files to be used as a lesson file. It will extract\nthe text and steno from the job and use it as a lesson. When the Start\nbutton is pressed it will begin playing the lesson.\nA realtime connection is established with the steno machine. The upper\nwindows will show the text and steno that the student must write. When the\nstudent writes on the steno machine, it will show the stroke the student\nwrote on the steno simulator window and will show the stroke in the lowerright\ncorner of the lesson window.\nIf the stroke is correct, the lower-left window will show the correct word that\nthe student wrote. It will then advance to the next stroke. If the student\nmakes a mistake, the steno machine will show the incorrect keys outlined in\nRED and the keys they were supposed to hit outlined in GREEN. They will be\nrequired to use the delete stroke to delete it before proceeding.\nAt the end of the lesson, the student will be given a report of mistakes and\nwords per minute.\nWhen you return to the Lesson Player, the steno window will preserve its size\nand position for the lesson player. For the lesson player dialog to remember\nits position, turn on the anchor button.\nThis lesson player also has mechanisms for showing only one word at a time\nfor beginners, and more advanced modes including hiding the steno and/or\nReference Guide 795\nthe emulator. There is also a paced mode that plays the lesson at a userdefined\nWPM and the student has to keep up.\nThe Support menu/Install lesson function looks in a subfolder of the\nEclipse folder called âLessonsâ to see if there are any lessons installed on the\ncomputer generally. If so, it will look there. If not, the user will select one\nfrom the Eclipse folder. They are permitted to navigate to a CD, floppy,\nnetwork, or wherever else they would like in order to find lessons to install.\nThe user can select and install a whole group of lesson files at once.\nOnce a lesson is selected for installation, Eclipse creates a âLessonsâ folder as\na subfolder of the userâs jobs folder. That way, that userâs individual lessons\ncan be modified by the user and the results will be stored specifically for that\nuser.\nOnce a lesson is installed, the user can select the Lesson player function\nand it will play one of the lessons from their personal lessons folder.\nRemember that lesson files are simply JobName.ecl files containing the\ndesired content. The easiest way to create content in a controlled way is to\nopen an empty .not file and use Ctrl+D (add entry) to add strokes to it\nmanually. Once the note file is complete, translate it and edit the resulting\ntranslation by globaling each stroke so that it is the correct word.\nThe functionality of the lesson can be controlled by the instructor who\ncreated the lesson by inserting a script command line at the very beginning\nof the lesson file. You can include several different commands separated by\nthe pipe sign (|) between the commands. These lines can support the\nextended path syntax such as {PROG}Lessons\\userfilename so that they will\nwork no matter where the program is installed.\nHere are the different commands that can be contained in that script line:\nTEXT -- This is a command stating that the lesson is a text content lesson\nand not a steno theory lesson. An example of a text lesson would be Keith\nVincent's editing tutorial.\nU=UserName -- This command will switch to a different user file before\nplaying the lesson. This may be necessary for special lessons that use special\nsettings, macros, etc.\nS=Speed -- This determines the speed of the lesson. The appropriate choices\nare as follows:\nS=-1 -- Setting the speed to -1 creates a word drill lesson that simply\ndisplays one word at a time and asks the user to write it on the machine.\nWhen the user writes it successfully, that word is removed and a new word\nappears.\nS=0 -- Setting the speed to 0 creates a text drill lesson that also\ndisplays one word at a time and waits for the user to write it, but it keeps\nadding the text to the end of what has been written, more like a regular\nrealtime translation. Note that for this and the previous lesson type, no\nmistakes are allowed. The user must use the delete stroke to correct any\nerror and write the stroke correctly before continuing.\n796 Eclipse Help\nS=120 -- (Sample) Setting the speed to ANY number greater than\nzero creates a speed drill lesson that displays the text at a constant number\nof words per minute. The student must keep up with the text or they may fall\ntoo far behind to see what has come up. In this type of lesson, the user is\npermitted to make mistakes and keep going without correcting them.\nNOM -- This specifies that no virtual steno machine will be shown during the\nlesson. The student will have to be familiar with the positions of the letters\non the machine in order to complete the lesson successfully.\nNOS -- This specifies that no steno should be shown in the lesson. In other\nwords, the word(s) will appear, but the student must remember how to write\nthem.\nNote that the NOM and the NOS flags can be used at any speed, so the\ninstructor can decide exactly what the progression should be from beginning\nto advanced and what resources should be available to the student at each\nstage.\nSince the behavior of the lesson is determined by these script commands, it\nis possible to create several versions of a lesson containing identical content,\nbut with different commands in order to create a progression for the student,\nfor example, from one speed to another. Here are some example lesson\ncommand lines:\nS=-1 -- Show all steno and the machine and only show one word at a time\nso the user can concentrate on that one word.\nS=0|NOM -- Show all the text coming up as it would in realtime and don't\nshow the steno machine; the student should know the keyboard by now.\nS=0|NOM|NOS -- Show all the text, but don't show the machine or the\nsteno; the student should know how to write the words in the lesson by now.\nS=40|NOS -- Play back the text at 40 words per minute and see if the\nstudent can keep up. Show the steno as a reminder.\nOne other note: After completing a lesson and after reporting the results of\nthe lesson in a window, the lesson player will record the results in a text file\nas well. The Lesson player results can be printed out, and each printout will\nhave the student's name on it.\nIn the user's âLessonsâ folder, there will be a file called\nLessonNameResults.txt (Example, if the lesson is called QADrill160.ecl, the\nresults will be called QADrill160Results.txt.)\nThis results file will record the results each time a student completes the\nlesson, so it will have a complete record of this student's history for that\nlesson. You can view this text file in a word processor or text editor of your\nchoice, or if desired you can import it into a spreadsheet and create progress\ncharts and graphs (the information is stored in consistent columns that most\nspreadsheet programs can easily import.)\nHere's a sample results file and the meaning of the headings:\nReference Guide 797\nCrect Incrt CWrds ToWrd Dletd Rpeat Skips JumpF JumpB usWPM\ntoWPM Accrt\n6 3 6 6 3 0 0 0 0 21 0\n100.0%\n6 1 6 6 1 0 0 0 0 34 0\n100.0%\n6 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 46 0\n100.0%\nCrect: The number of correct strokes by the user\nIncrt: The number of incorrect strokes by the user\nCWrds: The number of correct words by the user (complete dictionary\nentries, including multi-stroke words.)\nToWrd: The total number of words in the lesson\nDletd: The number of strokes that were deleted by the user\nRpeat: The strokes repeated by the user (if they back up and re-write a\nportion without deleting.)\nSkips: The number of strokes skipped by the user (if they fall behind in a\nspeed drill and have to jump ahead to keep up.)\nJumpF: The number of jumps forward (skips)\nJumpB: The number of jumps backward (repeats)\nusWPM: The words per minute the user wrote\ntoWPM: The original words per minute of the lesson\nAccrt: The accuracy rate (on non-speed drills, this will always be 100%\nbecause the user is required to correct mistakes.)\nSo in this sample file of a simple word drill, we can see that the student has\nimproved from 3 errors to 1 to 0, and has sped up from 21 WPM to 34 WPM\nto 46 WPM in three tries at the same lesson.\n22.12 Metadictionary Syntax and Codes\nMetadictionary Syntax and Codes\nRELATES TO: Metadictionary 850 , Programming Tab 826 .\n798 Eclipse Help\nThe Eclipse translator uses the metadictionary to interpret items in the\ndictionary, such as what {A} means, or {.}. The metadictionary tells the translator\nthat \"two\" is a written number. The Eclipse translator only understands a limited set\nof commands with a particular syntax. What you are accustomed seeing are actually\nentirely arbitrary short forms which the metadictionary expands into a form that the\ntranslator can understand.\nFor example, you could put -FRPBLGTS = {/\"Answer/?PGH} directly into your\nmain dictionary and the translator would know to insert a new Answer paragraph into\nthe document. However, the {A} short form is much easier to work with for most\nusers, and that's where the metadictionary comes in.\nItems in the metadictionary are essentially text replacement commands. For any\ndictionary entry, the translator breaks it up into text and commands, and then goes to\nthe metadictionary to find out how to interpret those pieces of text and commands.\nFor example, a dictionary entry that looks like this: TP-FRPBLGTS = {A}of\ncourse{,?} consists of three distinct parts. The metadictionary will be asked to\ninterpret each one separately:\n{A} --> {/\"Answer/?PGH}\nof course --> (no interpretation)\n{,?} --> {/</\"[,][.][:][;][],/?CPC}\nEven though there's no interpretation for \"of course,\" sometimes simple words\nor phrases do have an interpretation in the metadictionary. For example, \"dollars\" is\nin the metadictionary as {/\"%/?VMN} to indicate that it's a monetary value.\nThe metadictionary will keep replacing items until there are no interpretations\nremaining. For example, a captioner might have a metadictionary containing\n{Q}={N}>>{|}\nSo when that user writes {Q}, this is what the metadictionary does:\nPass 1:{Q} --> {N}>>{|}\nPass 2:{N} --> {/?PGD}\n>> --> (no change)\n{|} --> {/|>/?TPC}\nSo that ultimately, {Q} expands all the way out to\n{/?PGD}>>{|>/?TPC}\nIn addition to simply replacing one piece of text with another, the\nmetadictionary can also do a simple wildcard search pattern. For example, the\nfollowing metadictionary entry is used for speakers:\n{S:*}={/\"Speaker:%/?PGH}\nThe * is the wildcard, meaning that any entry containing {S:AnyText} will\nmatch. In the process of replacing the text, it will also find any % symbols that\nappear and will put the wildcard text in its place, so the replacement would be\n{/\"Speaker:AnyText/?PGH}. So when {S:MR. SMITH} what the translator will\nultimately be asked to translate is {/\"Speaker:MR. SMITH/?PGH}\nReference Guide 799\nIf there is no wildcard symbol, the % symbol can still be used to indicate the\nentire text to the left of the = sign. For example, the metadictionary entry\ndollar={/\"dollar/?VMN}\ndollars={/\"dollars/?VMN}\ncent={/\"cent/?VMN}\ncents={/\"cents/?VMN}\ncan be used to indicate monetary value words. However, it's much shorter just\nto put\ndollar={/\"%/?VMN}\ndollars={/\"%/?VMN}\ncent={/\"%/?VMN}\ncents={/\"%/?VMN}\nin the metadictionary. If you look at the metadictionary, you will find hundreds\nof entries like this containing different three-letter codes to identify some special\nproperty of the word without having to type the word into the metadictionary twice.\nThe real key to understanding what's in the metadictionary is understanding the\nlong forms of commands that the translator can use directly. Here is a breakdown of\nthe syntax one piece at a time:\nFirst, a command is always indicate by braces\n{command}\nEach attribute of the command preceded by a slash\n{/subcmd/subcmd/subcmd/etc..}\nEach subcommand has a special syntax. Here is a list of the optional\nsubcommands and what they do. Note that these subcommands can appear in any\norder, though they generally appear in the order shown to make it easier to read.\n/<text\nPrior text attribute. What appears after the < symbol is used to determine what\ntext separates the previous entry from the current one.\n/\"text\nEntry text attribute. What appears after the \" symbol is inserted literally into the\ndocument.\n/>text\nFollowing text attribute. What appears after the > symbol is used to determine\nwhat text separates the current entry from the next one.\n/|cmd\nCapitalization attribute. This will be followed by one of several symbols to\ndetermine what to capitalize surrounding this entry\n800 Eclipse Help\n/?cmd\nEntry type. This will be followed by a three-letter code indicating the specific\nbehavior of the entry\nSo here's a fully populated entry template, in the order specified above\n{/<text/\"text/>text/|cmd/?cmd}\nSpecial text\nTTL -- The entry text is a title, such as Mr. or Mrs. For example, {/\"Sgt./?TTL}\nwould insert \"Sgt.\" into the text and would cap the next word if it is not on the noncapping\nwords list.\nTAB -- A tab character. {/?TAB} will insert a tab at the current position. Entry\ntext currently does nothing, but may eventually specify the type of tab.\nPRE -- Entry text is a prefix. {/\"text/?PRE} is equivalent to {text^}\nSUF -- Entry text is a suffix. {/\"text/?SUF} is equivalent to {^suf}\nGLU -- Text indicates a glue entry. {/\"A/?GLU} would be a glue A. The default\nmetadictionary entry for this is {&*}={/\"%/?GLU}. Glue entries will stick to each\nother, but nothing else, making them ideal for various alphabets.\nSpecial syntax used by the glue entry is as follows:\nIf the text starts with a hyphen, it will be omitted from the first entry in a\nsequence of glue entries.\nIf the entry text contains the asterisk (*) it will be considered a template for\nfuture glue entries. The glue template may also contain one of the following\ncommands:\n| -- capitalizes all glue entries using this template\n< -- lower-cases all glue entries using this template\nExample: If you write {&<(*)} and then write {&A}{&B}{&C} you will get (a)\n(b)(c) instead.\nTIM -- Entry text is a time/date template. The current time/date will be added\nto the document using the template indicated. The default metadictionary entry for\nthis is {TM:*}={/\"%/?TIM}\nThe time/date template values are the same as the ones used by the\nEdit/Insert/Time date function:\nWeekdays\n%a - Abbreviated weekday name (Wed)\n%A - Full weekday name (Wednesday)\nReference Guide 801\nDays\n%d - day of the month (01-31)\n%#d - day of the month, no leading zero (1-31)\n%o - ordinal suffix for day of the month (st, nd, rd, th)\nMonths\n%b - Abbreviated month name (Dec)\n%B - Full month name (December)\n%m - Month as a number (01-12)\n%#m - Month as a number, no leading zero (1-12)\nYears\n%y - Year, two digits (0-99)\n%#y - Year, two digits, no leading zeroes (0-99 -- 2000 would appear as \"0\")\n%Y or %#Y - Year, four digits (1980-2030)\nTimes\n%H - hour, military time (00-23)\n%#H - hour, military time, no leading zero (0-23)\n%I - hour, 12-hour format (01-12)\n%#I - hour, 12-hour format, no leading zero (01-12)\n%M - minute (00-59)\n%#M - minute, no leading zero (0-59)\n%S - second (00-59)\n%#S - second, no leading zero (0-59)\n%p - AM/PM indicator (per your Windows time settings)\nCombined Codes\n%c - Complete date and time, numeric version (01/25/06 16:17:49)\n%#c - Complete date and time, long version (Thursday, January 5, 2006\n16:17:49)\n%x - Complete date, numeric version (01/25/06)\n%#x - Complete date, long version (Thursday, January 5, 2006)\n802 Eclipse Help\n%X - Complete time (16:17:49)\nOther\n%j - Day of the year, number (001-366)\n%#j - Day of the year, number, no leading zeroes (001-366)\n%U - Week, number (00-51) NOTE: week starts on Sunday\n%#U - Week, number, no leading zero (0-51)\n%w - Weekday as number (Sunday=0, Monday=1, etc., through Saturday=6)\n%z or %Z - Time Zone name (Eastern Standard Time)\nFor example, {TM:%#I:%M:%S %p} or {/\"%#I:%M:%S %p/?TIM} will show\nthe current time as Hour:Minute:Second in 12-hour time with no leading zero,\nfollowed by a space, then the am/pm indicator according to the computer's current\nsettings under Control panel/Regional and language options.\nText types\nThese entries all add text to the document. The different codes allow you to\ndefine what type of text is being inserted. Note that normal, translated text is\nindicated with TXT, and if a metadictionary entry contains no three-letter code, TXT is\nassumed.\nTXT -- Normal translated text\nTXU -- Untranslate\nTXC -- Conflict\nTXP -- User-selected conflict\nTXI -- Computer-selected conflict\nTXY -- Typed-in text\nTXS -- Scopist text\nTXA -- Automatic text (paragraph auto-punctuation)\nTXR -- Redacted text\nTXF-- Form field\nExample, {/\"(CHECK)/?TXU} would insert (CHECK) into the document as an\nuntranslate and scans for untranslate text would stop on it.\nWhen adding a form field, the syntax for the text is as follows:\nSymbolResult\n^ Variable-sized field\nD Delete the line if empty\nReference Guide 803\nC Capitalize the results\nL Last field\nR Right-flush\nP Prompt for variable contents\n<filename Use a list file\n|name Use a variable name\nâlabel Use a label\nYou should always use the single-character flags in the field first, followed by\nany flags that contain additional data.\nFor example, to insert an adjustable field that deletes the line if empty, labeled\nPlaintiff with a variable named PLF, you can use the following:\n{FL:^D\"Plaintiff|PLF}\nNumber flags\nThe following codes are all used by the number conversion procedures to identify\nwhich words are number-related words and should be processed in a certain way by\nthe number conversion. Other than that, the entry text will be translated normally.\nNote that most of these will appear in the metadictionary with little or no\nembellishment, simply as something like foot={/\"%/?SMT}\nVDG -- Digit (3)\nVOD -- Ordinal digit (3rd)\nVWO -- Written out number (three)\nVOR -- Written out ordinal number (third)\nVGP or VDV -- Grouping/dividing word (and)\nVMG -- Order of magnitude (thousand/million/billion/etc.)\nVMO -- Ordinal order of magnitude (thousandth/millionth/billionth/etc.)\nVDP -- Decimal point\nVMN -- Monetary unit (dollars/cents/yen)\nSMT -- Singular measurement (foot)\nPMT -- Plural measurement (feet)\nVOS -- Ordinal suffix (st/nd/rd/th)\nNUM -- Number trigger. The default metadictionary entry for this is {#*}\n={/\"%/?NUM}. The entry text is the number trigger command, which must be one of\nthe following:\nQ -- Quantity (contains commas)\n804 Eclipse Help\nM -- Money. This defaults to the first currency type on the currency list in the\nnumber vocabulary. To specify a different type of currency, add the currency shortcut\nletter as indicated on the currency list. For example, MY would be yen.\nG -- Generic digits (no commas)\nR -- Roman numerals\nr -- lower-case roman numerals\nO -- Ordinal numbers\nP -- Phone number\nS -- Social security number\nZ -- Zip code\nT -- Time\nD -- Date\nDM -- Date in month/day format (9/8 instead of '98)\n1 through 9 -- User-defined template\nW -- Written-out number\nN -- Digits\nGrammar\nThe internal database automatically determines the parts of speech of each word\nthat translates for the purpose of selecting conflicts and for other grammar analysis. If\nyou find that certain words are not being recognized appropriately, you can add\nmetadictionary entries to tell the software specifically what part of speech it is. For\nexample, a metadictionary entry of texting={/\"%/?GRV} tells the translator that\n\"texting\" is a verb (which is probably too modern to appear in the database.)\nHere are the codes:\nGRN -- Noun\nGRV -- Verb\nGRJ -- Adjective\nGRA -- Adverb\nGRP -- Preposition\nGRT -- Article\nGRC -- Conjunction\nGRR -- Pronoun\nGRO -- Contraction\nGRS -- Possessive\nReference Guide 805\nThere are also a few language-specific items for Italian:\nITR -- Neutral\nITE -- Feminine\nITF -- Plural feminine\nITM -- Masculine\nITP -- Plural\nand French:\nFRM -- Plural noun\nFRS -- Singular participle\nFRP -- Participle\nFRF -- First person participle\nPunctuation\nPunctuation metadictionary entries are the ones that rely most heavily on the\nprior text, entry text, following text and capitalization variants in order for the entries\nto behave as expected. The three-letter codes are used to supply a small amount of\nadditional functionality and to trigger the grammar analysis procedures to recognize\nthe different types of punctuation.\nTPC -- Terminal punctuation. This ensures that if the entry is told to capitalize\nthe next word, it will always capitalize it even if the next word is on the non-capping\nwords list. This will prevent automatic paragraph punctuation in all circumstances\nregardless of the punctuation mark actually being added. (So it will work for a period,\nquestion mark and exclamation point, or any other composite punctuation entry that\nis going to end a sentence.)\nFor some terminal punctuation (period, question mark, double-dash) you may\nwant to change the number of spaces that follow the punctuation from two to one, if\nyou are exporting the transcript to be printed in a proportional font. to do this, select\nthe entry, for example the {.} for the period, and change the \"Force right boundary\ntext\" from two spaces to one.\n806 Eclipse Help\nYou can create a specialized dictionary that prevents automatic punctuation from\nbeing added, use the TPC code. For example, the following entry:\n{) }={/</â)/?TPC}\nwould add a closing paren, but treat it as a terminal punctuation, so hitting {Q}\nor {A} or {N} after it would NOT cause a period or question mark to be added after\nthe close paren.\nThis is required for some situations in which the paragraph ends in a narrative,\nsuch as (nods head) which some users prefer not to have a period either inside or\noutside the parens if it's the last thing in the paragraph.\nCPC -- Comma punctuation. Use this for commas and semicolons or anywhere\nelse where there is a division between two sentence fragments.\nDPC -- Dash punctuation. Use this for dashes and ellipses or anywhere else\nwhere an interruption can occur abruptly in the middle of a phrase.\nTGE -- Toggling punctuation. Any punctuation mark that toggles between\nopened and closed and/or which must have a different character or characters for\neach instance should use this code. For example, parentheses. For toggling entries,\nthere is a different syntax used for the alternate text: /' instead of /\"\nExample: {/\"(/')/?TGE} is the toggling entry for parens. The first time this entry\nis written, it will translate as ( and be attached to the following word. The second time\nthis entry is written, it will translate as ) and attach to the previous word.\nReference Guide 807\nGRQ -- beginning of a quotation. You can specify that certain words imply that a\nsubsequent initial quote is the beginning of a quotation (as opposed to a rhetorical\ndevice.) For example, you can place the following in your metadictionary:\nsaid={/\"%/?GRQ}\nThat will mean that if you write: he / said / { \"} / let's go / {.} / {\" }\nyou will get: he said, \"Let's go.\"\nbut if you write: he / said / he / was / { \"} / just saying / {.} / {\" }\nyou will get: he said he was \"just saying.\"\n22.12.1 Metadictionary Codes\nAdditional syntax and codes\nPrior text\n/<text\nIf you omit this command, the default prior text will be the following text\nspecified by the previous dictionary entry. If nothing has been specified, it will simply\nbe one space. You may use a tilde (~) to indicate a lockspace. If there is no text at all\nafter the < symbol, then that indicates to the translator that there should be no space\nat all between the current entry and the previous one.\nThe prior text of any entry may be omitted entirely if the entry before it requires\nthat it be followed by the next entry immediately. For example, if preceded by a prefix\nor a new paragraph command, the next entry will have its prior text omitted. For\nexample, a simplified version of the dash metadictionary entry looks like this:\n{/<~/\"--}\nwhich means that the prior text is a lockspace. When the dash appears at the\nbeginning of a paragraph, the prior text (lockspace) is omitted.\nIn addition to containing this optionally omitted text, the prior text command can\ncontain instructions telling the translator to go back and delete translated text from\nthe document. The command for this is the carat symbol (^) and the number of carats\nindicates how many characters it should delete.\n{/<^^^ /\"test} -- This entry would first delete three characters and then add a\nspace before adding the word \"test.\"\nThe carats are most commonly used conditionally. If the carats are followed by a\nset of characters in brackets, then the translator only has permission to delete\ncharacters that match any of the characters in brackets.\n{/<^^^^^[ ~-] /\"test} -- This entry would first delete up to five prior\ncharacters, as long as they were either spaces, lockspaces or hyphens, then add a\nspace before adding the word \"test.\"\n808 Eclipse Help\nThis mechanism is normally used with punctuation entries so that one type of\npunctuation mark has permission to remove a punctuation mark that precedes it. For\nexample, a simplified version of the period metadictionary would look like this:\n{/<^^^[,?:;~-]/\".} -- This entry has permission to delete up to three prior\ncharacters, as long as they are each a comma, question mark, colon, semi-colon,\nlockspace or hyphen. Note that it does not have a space after the closing bracket,\nbecause after doing the deletion, there should be no prior text at all between the\nprevious entry and the current entry, which is a period.\nEntry text\n/\"text\nThe entry text is normally inserted literally into the document. The following\nentry\n{/\"text}\nwould simply insert the word \"text\" into the document. The one special command\nthat is available universally in the entry text is conditional text, which is used to\ndetermine what the text of the entry should be based solely on the text that precedes\nit. The syntax is\n[condition1]text1[condition2]text2 [condition3]text3[]defaulttext\nExample:\n{/\"[Mr.]Greene[Mrs.]Greene[]green}\nThis entry would add \"Greene\" if preceded specifically by Mr. or Mrs., and would\notherwise add the word \"green\" instead. Note that empty brackets [] are used to\nindicate the default text that is used if none of the other conditions are met.\nJust as the conditional search text is left blank on the last item, the entry text\nitself can be left blank if one of the conditions should result in no text being added at\nall. This ability of conditional text is most commonly used to omit punctuation when\nthere is already a punctuation mark present:\n{/\"[,][.][?][],} -- This entry would normally add a comma, but if there is\nalready a comma there, or a period or a question mark, it will add nothing at all. This\nis the basic principle behind the {,?} \"soft comma\" dictionary entry.\nFinally, there are many specialized entry codes that require a specific syntax for\nthe entry text that is unique to that entry code. These special syntaxes will be covered\nin the notes for those specific codes.\nFollowing text\n/>text\nBy default, the following text will be a single space. If the > symbol is followed\nby no text at all, that indicates to the translator that the current entry should be\nfollowed immediately by the next entry without any space between them.\nReference Guide 809\nThis is most commonly used by punctuation entries to indicate which entries\nshould be followed by two spaces. For example, a simplified period entry would look\nlike this:\n{/</\"./> } -- This indicates no space before the period and two spaces after it.\nThe one specialized syntax that can be used in the following text is the <\nsymbol, which is used to indicate that the following text should be a copy of the\nfollowing text from the previous dictionary entry. This is used by certain types of\npunctuation and/or commands where the spacing from the previous entry should be\ncarried forward. For example, if the closing quote is written like this\n{/\"\"/><}\nThen it will work in both of the following situations:\n...go away.\" Then he left...\n...go away\" very loudly...\nIn each situation, the quote is followed by the number of spaces indicated by the\nprevious entry. In the first case, the period indicates two spaces. In the second case,\nthe default of one space is used.\nCapitalization\n/|cmd\nThe capitalization attribute only has three possible syntaxes:\n/|> -- this capitalizes the next word\nExample\n{/</\"./> /|>} -- A period should capitalize the next word\n/|< -- this capitalizes the previous word\n{/\"Street/|<} -- This would capitalize the word before \"Street.\"\n/|- -- this capitalizes the word according to the capitalization rule for the\nprevious entry.\nSee the quote example above. The actual syntax for the ending quote entry\nshould be\n{/\"\"/></|-} -- This will capitalize the word after the quote only if the entry\ninside the quote was an item such as terminal punctuation that requests the next word\nto capitalize.\nEntry type\n/?CMD\nThe three-letter entry codes are the most important part of the syntax of the\nmetadictionary. They indicate many special behaviors that the normal syntax cannot\nindicate. In some cases, they supersede the other commands, and in other cases they\naugment it in some way. It will be easiest to divide these codes into groups which\nhave similar behaviors.\n810 Eclipse Help\nMode commands\nCommands are the simplest types of metadictionary entries. They only ever\nappear in the form {/?AAA} because they don't add text. They just turn a particular\nmode on or off. There always three versions of each, with a last letter of O for \"on\", F\nfor \"off\" and T for \"toggle\", which switches it both on and off.\nCPO, CPF, CPT -- Capitalization mode. This initial caps each word with the\nexception of words that appear on the non-capping words list. {/?CPO}department of\ninternal affairs{?/CPF} would appear \"Department of Internal Affairs.\"\nACO, ACF, ACT -- All caps mode. This capitalizes every letter. {/?ACO}dare{/?\nACF} would appear DARE.\nLCO, LCF, LCT -- Literal case mode. This is used when doing closed captioning or\nCART where the text is normally in all caps. It is often used for single characters such\nas CDs or McTAVISH but can also be used for longer words. When outputting in all\ncaps, \"{/?LCO}Mr. Jones:{/?LCF} Welcome back.\" would appear \"Mr. Jones: WELCOME\nBACK.\"\nDCO, DCF, DCT -- Downcase mode. This forces every letter into lower case. It's\nmost commonly used for websites and other situations where a normally capitalized\nword should be lower case. {/?DCO}WWW.SmithandJones.COM{/?DCF}\nwould appear as www.smithandjones.com\nGLO, GLF, GLT -- Glue mode. In this mode, everything written behaves as a glue\nentry and sticks together. Primary uses for this are faking out attorneys by telling\nthem that everything automatically runs together when talk too quickly, and writing\nwebsite addresses. {/?GLO}www. cars for sale.com{/?GLF} will appear as\nwww.carsforsale.com\nSimple commands\nThese commands don't have on/off versions because they perform a function\nimmediately when executed which is always the same\nCCB -- Blanks the closed captioning screen (normally set up as {BLANK}={/?\nCCB} in the metadictionary)\nCCF -- Flushes the output to the closed captioning screen (or any other output\ntype) {FLUSH}={/?CCF}\nABD -- Deletes (rejects) the last auto-brief suggestion {ABREJECT}={/?ABD}\nABN -- Offers a new auto-brief suggestion for the last item {ABNEW}={/?ABN}\nFile commands\nMany codes use the entry text for something other than text to be inserted\nliterally. With these commands, the entry text should be a filename, and Eclipse will\nperform a function with that file\nINC -- Include the filename indicated into the current transcript. {/\"cover/?\nINC} would include the cover.ecl file from the block files folder into the transcript at\nthe current location (normally {<*}={/\"%/?INC} in the metadictionary.)\nReference Guide 811\nSND -- Plays the sound file indicated in its entirety as a sound effect. It starts\nthe sound and immediately continues executing. {/\"slowdown/?INC} would play the\nslowdown.wav file from the EclipseNT folder on your system. Might I suggest a\nrecording of someone who sounds like James Earl Jones saying \"Words-per-minute\noverload. Please speak slowly.\"\nSNC -- Plays sound excerpts that need to be played sequentially, so that it is\nimpossible for the second sound to start while the first one is playing\nCCC -- Closed captioning credit file. Sends the file indicated to the closed\ncaptioning output as a standalone credit file. Similar to the INC for doing includes, but\ninstead does the equivalent of a \"send script line\" on the contents of the file so that it\ncan send pop-on credits.\nParagraph formatting\nPGH -- Inserts a paragraph into the document using the following syntax. Note\nthat the entry text must be provided, by the prior text is optional. Using a space as the\ndefault terminal punctuation mark is equivalent to requesting no punctuation mark at\nall.\n{/<AutomaticPunctuation/\"ParagraphName:ParagraphLabel/?PGH}\nExamples:\n{/<./\"Answer/?PGH} -- Inserts an Answer paragraph using a period as the\nautomatic punctuation mark instead of the default question mark.\n{/\"Question:Q. ***/?PGH} -- Inserts a Question paragraph using \"Q. ***\" as\nthe label instead of the default label for a Question paragraph.\n{PJ:*}={/\"Speaker:PROSPECTIVE JUROR %/?PGH} -- Inserts a Speaker\nparagraph using \"PROSPECTIVE JUROR SMITH\" as the label when the original\ndictionary entry is {PJ:SMITH}\nPGD -- Inserts a default continuation paragraph according to the continuation\nparagraph setting of the current paragraph type in the document. This does not use\nthe entry text for anything, though you can specify a different default terminal\npunctuation mark.\nPGA -- Automatically determines a paragraph type based on the left and right\nmargins requested. If the requested paragraph type does not exist, it will create a new\nparagraph type in the current document based on the \"Normal\" paragraph type but\nforcing it to use the margins indicated. This is used primarily by closed captioners. The\nsyntax of the entry text is \"LeftMargin,RightMargin\" For example, {/\"8,32/?PGA} will\nfind the first paragraph type with a left margin of 8 and a right margin of 32.\nThis is normally implemented in the metadictionary as {H:*}={/\"%/?PGA} so\nthat captioners can use entries such as {H:4,28} to force a particular horizontal\nalignment for the captions.\nCCP -- Determines vertical position for closed captioning. Technically, this isn't\na paragraph format, but it's very similar to the above entry for horizontal positioning.\n{POS:*}={/\"%/?CCP} is the normal metadictionary entry. The entry text is in the\nform \"StartingRow,TotalRows\". Example, {/\"1,2/?CCP} or {POS:1,2} would set the\nclosed captioning display to start on row 1, with 2 total rows of captions.\n812 Eclipse Help\nPRT -- Inserts a print command. The entry text is the exact print command\nname from the list of print commands. For example, {/\"Page break/?PRT} will add a\npage break. The default entry in the metadictionary is {PRT:*}={/\"%/?PRT}\nATP -- Sets the default terminal punctuation for the end of the current\nparagraph in the document to the entry text of this entry. Note that this will be\nignored if any terminal punctuation is written between this entry and the end of the\nparagraph. Example: {/\"?/?ATP} will set the terminal punctuation mark at the end of\nthe current paragraph to a question mark. {>?} and {>.} are default metadictionary\nentries (defined as {/\"?/?ATP} and {/\"./?ATP} respectively.) These can be used in\nsituations where particular words or phrases make it virtually certain that the current\nparagraph will end with a punctuation mark other than the normal default punctuation.\nFor example, if you define the strokes for \"please state\" as \"please state{>.}\"\nthen the question will ultimately end in a period instead of a question mark, so you\nwill get\nQ. Please state your name and address.\nA. Joe Smith, etc...\nwithout having to remember to write the period at the end of the Question\nparagraph.\nFonts\nThese commands are used for changing the current font or font attribute\nFNT -- Change the font to the font defined by the current entry text. The entry\ntext must be in the following form. Note that any part of this sequence can be omitted\nand the system will simply assign zeros to it:\nFontName,Size,Weight,VerticalOffset,attribute1,attribute2,attribute3,etc. (note\nthat the attributes can be in any order, but every item before that must be filled in or\nset to zero)\nFontName is the name of the font as it appears in the windows font dialog, such\nas \"Courier New\" or \"Arial\"\nSize is the point size as it appears in the windows font dialog, such as \"13\"\nWeight is a number indicate normal, bold, light, etc. It can be set to any number\nalong a range. Here is a table of the typical values as defined by Windows (not all\nfonts support all possible values.)\nDon't care 0\nThin 100\nExtra light 200\nLight 300\nNormal 400\nMedium 500\nSemi-bold 600\nReference Guide 813\nBold 700\nExtra-bold 800\nBlack 900\nVertical offset is the distance that the font moves up and down on the page in\ntwips. Negative numbers move up. This is typically used for superscripts and\nsubscripts.\nAttributes can be any of the following:\nitalic/underline/strikeout/CRRGGBB\nCRRGGBB is a color command, where RR, GG and BB represent the\nred/green/blue values of the color in hexadecimal notation from 00 to FF. If you really\nwant font colors different from the default metadictionary entries for {BLUE}, {RED},\netc., where these values are already filled in for you, you can experiment with the color\nselector under User settings/Display/Colors. Once you find a color you like, you can\nconvert the Red/Green/Blue values from that dialog to hexadecimal using the\nWindows/Accessories/Calculator.\nExample:\n{/\"Arial,13,700,-80,italic,C00FFFF/?FNT} would turn the current font to Arial 13-\npoint, bold, superscripted, italicized and cyan. The font change command is normally\ndefined as {F:*}={/\"%/?FNT} so that you can type {F:Symbol,13} for example to get\nmath symbols.\nFNN -- Select a particular font number from the User\nsettings/Document/Advanced/Master font table. Normally, this is implemented as\n{FN:*}={/\"%/?FNN}. This is usually only useful for changing to different fonts if you\nhave a consistent font table that you use for all documents. The one exception to that\nis that font number zero is always the default font, so if you need to have a dictionary\nentry that needs to change to a particular font for a brief piece of text and then change\nright back again, it's much faster to put {FN:0} than it is to put {F:Courier New,13},\nfor example.\nFNA -- Change a font attribute without changing the font size or typeface. This\nis a shortcut to get underline, italics, bold, superscript and subscript. The entry text\ndetermines which attributes to select.\nThe attributes can be any of the following:\nunder/bold/italic/super/sub\nExample: {/\"bold,italic/?FNA} would change the current font to bold and italic.\nThe weight value used for bold, as well as the vertical offset values used for\nsuperscript and subscript, are in the Font attributes dialog that you can see if you\nblock mark a piece of text and hit Ctrl+Hyphen.\nThese attribute items are already present in the metadictionary using extreme\nshortcuts for every possible combination of the lower-case letters u/b/i with an n for\nnormal: {u} is underscore on, {bi} or {ib} is bold and italics, {n} is normal, etc.\n814 Eclipse Help\nNote that the superscript on and off commands are somewhat different due to\nthe inclusion of commands to delete spaces. For example, a dictionary entry reading\n\"the{I}Times{n}crossword\" should appear \"the Times crossword\" but \"H{subon}\n2{suboff}O\" should appear H2O. Also note that by default, the sub/super\nmetadictionary entries do not change the font size, but it is certainly possible to do so\nusing the font change commands.\n22.13 Network Installation\nNetwork Installation\nThe location of program and data files on Eclipse is dictated by the settings in the\nECLIPSE.INI file which is found in the primary operating system directory. Note that\nthis will usually be C:\\WINDOWS, but on a network using âthinâ clients, it will be\ndictated by the network settings.\nThe installation program for Eclipse asks where you wish to install the program, and\nby default, that will be the program directory. The default MAIN directory will be a\nsubfolder of that directory called âUsers.â Note that the main directory can be changed\narbitrarily, but if you change the program directory, the program files must be\nrelocated to the new directory you choose. The settings appear in the ECLIPSE.INI file\nas follows. Note that their order and position in the file is not relevant.\nProgramDirectory=C:\\Program Files\\Advantage Software\\Eclipse\nMainDirectory=C:\\Program Files\\Advantage Software\\Eclipse\\Users\nNotes on the different methods:\nMethod 1 is recommended for installations where each client is a full computer with\nits own hard drive.\nMethod 2 is recommended for thin client installations where each user of the network\nmay need to access other userâs files, particularly if reporters are going to be doing a\nlot of job sharing or if they edit each otherâs material, or if scopists use the system\nfrequently and need to have easy access to any reporterâs files.\nMethod 3 is recommended for thin client installations where each user wishes to\nkeep their own material secure and separate from other users, but it is still necessary\nto have the data on the server in order for each user to be able to use any of the\navailable client computers on the network.\nReference Guide 815\nIn this example, each CLIENT machine is a fully independent computer with its own\nhard drive (C:) and which has access to the file server (For example, a G: drive.)\nThe network administrator could set up a G:\\Eclipse\\Users directory, for example, and\nthen the Main directory setting could be changed to:\nMainDirectory=G:\\Eclipse\\Users\nGiven that setting, any time a new user was created on any one of the clients, it\nwould create a UserName subdirectory in the MainDirectory and would put the\nUserName.ini file in the MainDirectory, as well.\nNote that this method also permits ANY client machine to have access to ANY of the\nuser files, making it possible to have a pool of networked computers that any\nindividual user can use and still have access to their own files. Eclipse does have a\npassword feature for the user settings, though this measure is more for convenience\nthan for airtight security. If thorough security is desired, that should be implemented\nby establishing user-level network directory access rights.\n816 Eclipse Help\nI\nIn this example, the network is using âthinâ clients with no hard drives. They\nuse the server for all data storage.\nIt is necessary for each client to have its own independent copy of the Eclipse\nprogram files directory. The reason for this is that a number of the program files can\nbe modified by the user (such as the spelling dictionaries) so they cannot be opened\nby multiple computers simultaneously.\nIn this example, each client computer logs in and has its own program directory. For\nexample,\nProgramDirectory=G:\\EclProg1\nProgramDirectory=G:\\EclProg2\nProgramDirectory=G:\\EclProg3\nHowever, for client computer to have access to any userâs files, it is still permissible to\nhave a single main directory, as in the previous example:\nMainDirectory=G:\\Eclipse\\Users\nThis method allows each client to have access to any user files, even though each\nclient has its own copy of the program on the server.\nReference Guide 817\nThis is another example using âthinâ clients with no hard drives.\nIn this example, each client computer logs in and has its own program directory AND\nits own data directory. For example,\nProgramDirectory=G:\\EclProg1\nMainDirectory=G:\\EclProg1\\Users\nProgramDirectory=G:\\EclProg2\nMainDirectory=G:\\EclProg2\\Users etc..\nItâs important to note that depending on the network architecture, these clients may\nshare a single âsystemâ directory where the ECLIPSE.INI is stored. If that is the case,\nthen it will be impossible to have three different ECLIPSE.INI files. Instead, the\ndesired effect will have to be accomplished by using user-level drive mapping.\nFor example, John and Mary each have an I: drive, but itâs different for each user.\nJohnâs I: drive is mapped to G:\\JOHN and Maryâs I: drive is mapped to G:\\MARY. In\nthat, case the ECLIPSE.INI file would read:\nProgramDirectory=I:\\Eclipse MainDirectory=I:\\Eclipse\\Users\nBut the data would ACTUALLY be stored in G:\\JOHN\\Eclipse and G:\\JOHN\\Eclipse\\Users for\nJohn and in G:\\MARY\\Eclipse and G:\\MARY\\Eclipse\\Users for Mary.\n22.14 Normalization Entries\nNormalization Entries\n818 Eclipse Help\nNormalization entries are definable in the User Settings/Programming\ntab. A number of entries are included in the Eclipse.set file by default.\nWhen the globaling and dictionary entry adding routines suggest additional\nentries, it will suggest them according to your own personalized steno theory.\nSome reporters double consonants; others don't. Some will regularly move\ncertain consonants across stroke boundaries but not others. Some will\nsubstitute â-Fâ for â-Sâ in some situations, some won't.\nHere is the syntax for a normalization entry:\nend/start,end/start,end/start,end/start...\nIn other words, you put in the steno characters that can appear at the end of\none stroke and the beginning of the next stroke, and you list all of the\ndifferent variations that the system should consider equivalent.\nExample:\n/KR,BG/R,BG/KR\nThis means that if you global PHABG/ROE = macro, it will also suggest\nPHA/KROE and PHABG/KROE. Here are the three possibilities with the\nnormalized steno in capital letters, just to make it easier to compare against\nthe normalization setting:\nphaBG/Roe\nphaBG/KRoe\npha/KRoe\nNote that in order for normalization to work, you MUST specify which central\nstroke letters are to be used as boundaries. The vowels make the best\nboundary letters. In order to apply a normalization, BOTH sides of the\nnormalized strokes must be immediately bounded by the boundary letters.\nNote in the above example how there is an âAâ on the left of the normalized\nboundary and an âOâ on the right.\nSo the very first entry in the normalization table MUST be a list of the\nboundary letters, such as AO*EU\nWhy boundaries? Consider the following:\nB/,/PW,B/PW\nThat WILL be applied to RAB/EUT = rabbit, making RA/PWEUT and\nRAB/PWEUT.\nIt will NOT be applied to ARB/EPB = ashen, even though it has âB/â in it;\nAR/PWEPB and ARB/PWEPB wouldn't make sense in this case. Using the\nvowels as boundaries prevents this from happening.\n826\nReference Guide 819\nIt also explains why the normalization table has so many entries that seem\nduplicative; it's why you need both RS/,R/S,RS/S and LS/,L/S,LS/S even\nthough S/,/S,S/S is already on the list. ALL of the consonant combinations\nneed to be explicitly defined.\nThe Normalize function will support double consonants. So, for example, if\nyou make a global of âHRAD/ER = ladderâ the normalize function used to\nsuggest âHRA/TKER = ladderâ as a different way you could write the same\nphonetic equivalent.\nIt will ALSO suggest that the âdâ sound could be doubled, which many\nreporters do, so it will suggest âHRAD/TKER = ladderâ as well.\n22.15 Number templates\nNumber templates\nCreating and editing user templates:\n1. In the Templates box, select an undefined User template (User 1âUser 9)\nby clicking once on the name.\n2. Once youâve selected the User template name, click in the empty field at\nthe top of the templates area.\n3. Enter the format that you want the number to take. A pound sign\nrepresents a place where a digit will go: any other character will become\npart of the number formatting. For example, if you want to create a\ntemplate for Australian phone numbers (which are formatted 1234-5678),\nyou would enter ####-####.\n4. Press Enter to save the format. You may use your custom conversion code\nin dictionary entries, and in other parts of the Numbers tab such as the\n____ Digits = ________ option. The dictionary entry syntax is {#3},\nwhere 3 is the code number. In the drop-down list on the Numbers tab, it\nwill appear as \"User 3.\"\nDo not reassign codes 0 or 10. These are used for the {#D} and {#P}\ndefault codes, respectively. Change these only if you want to change the\nappearance of your dates or phone numbers.\nTo edit a template, select the template from the list in the Templates\narea and enter the new format in the entry field at the top of the list, as\ndescribed above. You can delete what is already in the field or edit it by\ndeleting and typing.\n820 Eclipse Help\nTemplate syntax:\nUse the number sign (#) to represent a digit on the template and type\nother characters or symbols as you want them to appear in the formatted\nnumber. For example, if you want 8-digit numbers to be formatted with 5\ndigits in parentheses followed by a dash and the last 3 digits, you would\nenter (#####)-### in the template field.\nIf a number template starts with â<â it will fill it from right-to-left\ninstead of the normal behavior, which is left-to-right. For example: 12345 --\n###-### becomes 123-45 and <###-### becomes 12-345.\nNumber templates in dictionary entries\nYou can specify a number template directly in a dictionary entry, using\nthe format {#template}. Keep in mind that the first # is the command, and\nthe rest are digit placeholders, so a dictionary entry of {###-##} is actually\na template of ##-##.\nNote that you can still use the left/right fill commands, so a dictionary\nentry of {#<$###.##} would fill from right to left, and a dictionary entry of\n{#>#####[-####]} would fill from left to right.\nOptional Portions in Number Templates\nSometimes, parts of a number template should not be used if the number\nisn't long enough. For example, with the phone number (###)###-####,\nthe parens around the area code should be removed if there are no area code\ndigits. Processing for the phone number happens automatically, but you can\nmake user-defined templates to remove non-digit parts of a number\ntemplate.\nFor any part of a number template that is optional, put the entire portion in\nbrackets. For example, for the phone number, the equivalent user-defined\ntemplate would be <[(###)]###-### (note the < meaning the field is\nfilled in from right to left.)\nAnother example would be a nine-digit zip code: #####[-####] If you\nwrite 34994, you get 34994. If you write 349940625 you get 34994-0625\nThis is also useful for a money template that fills in the decimal point and\nonly puts in commas where necessary:\n<$[###,][###,][###,]###.##\nLet's say that was template 5. So, for example, if you write 725{#5} you get\n$7.25. If you write 436782{#5} you get $4,367.82, etc.\nThis number template is integral to the Phoenix theory of number writing.\nKeep in mind that if you use this template, you MUST write the cents\namounts, even if they're zeros, and you MUST write any filler zeros, so if you\nneeded to indicate five dollars you would need to write 5/0/0/{#5} to get\n$5.00 and to indicate two dollars and seven cents you would have to write\n2/0/7/{#5} to get $2.07. If you wanted a dollar amount without any cents at\nall, you would need a different template or just use {#M}. Most Eclipse users\nReference Guide 821\nuse the word âdollarsâ which will interpret dollar amounts correctly in all\ncircumstances without requiring extra strokes or filler zeros.\n22.16 Number Vocabulary\nNumber Vocabulary\nRELATES TO: Numbers tab .\nIn User Settings/Numbers, you can click the Vocabulary setup button to open the\nNumber vocabulary dialog and customize many settings for translation of numbers.\n264\n822 Eclipse Help\nChanging the written word for a number using the Value and Word\nfields\nYou can use the Value and Word fields to set the words used to represent\nnumbers. The Value field contains a drop-down menu of numerals with a\ncorresponding menu of words for numerals. When an item is selected from this list, its\ncorresponding written form appears in the Word field. Edit the entry in the Word\nfield to change the translation of the written form of the number.\nSetting words and symbols for decimals\nReference Guide 823\nDecimal word refers to the word typically used to indicate a decimal, such as\nâpointâ in âninety-eight point six.â âPointâ is by default used as the decimal word.\nDecimal symbol refers to the symbol that is used in decimal numbers. The\ndefault symbol is a period, which is what is used in the U.S.\nTime symbol\nThe number vocabulary contains a symbol used to indicate time, so that you can\nget translations like 9.45 in places like the UK. The default symbol is a colon.\nGrouping Word - Setting compound numbers\nThe Grouping word refers to the word used to join the numbers in a\nâcompoundâ number. This is where you let Eclipse know what word is used to\ncombine numbers, so you can control how such numbers are translated. For example,\nâone hundred and forty eightâ can be translated as â148â rather than â100 and 48.â\nIf you donât want to have numbers combined in this fashion, uncheck the Process\nâandâ as a number field in User Settings/Numbers.\nOrdinal suffixes\nThe Ordinal field contains the ten suffixes associated with the numbers zero\nthrough ten that are used to indicate ordinal values (first, second, third, etc.). Edit\nany suffix in this field as desired. Note: the first suffix in the field corresponds to the\nzeroth place (ordinal numbers ending in zero, such as tenth, 50th, and millionth).\nSubsequent suffixes are for ordinals ending in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.\nA special exception stops constructions like âone secondâ and âone fifthâ from\ntranslating as â12thâ and â15thâ, no matter what the settings. If Eclipse sees the\nword for (1)(one) immediately before an ordinal number word, it will keep them\nseparate.\nAutomatic [Month(ordinal), year] format\nThe translator can use a format for the number conversion which handles a\nsequence of undifferentiated digits following a month name. Note that in order to use\nthis, you will have to change your metadictionary entries for your month names to use\n/\"DY or /\"DO instead of /\"N following the month name.\nIf you use DY, it will use \"day, year\" format, such as \"May 3, 2010.\" If you use\nDO, it will use \"ordinal day, year\" format, such as \"May 3rd, 2010.\"\nUsing this format, you can write a sequence of anywhere from 1 to 6 digits\nfollowing a month name, and the system should determine what format you want\nbased on the number of digits and the contents:\nX --> May X\nXX --> May XX\nXXX --> May X, 'XX\n824 Eclipse Help\nXXXX --> if XXXX starts with 19 or 20,then May AABB, otherwise May AA, 'BB\nXXXXX --> May X, XXXX\nXXXXXX --> May XX, XXXX\nCurrency setup\nEclipse is set to handle dollars and some additional currencies. If you need to\nwork with other currencies, you can set them in the Currency setup field (User\nSettings/Numbers/Vocabulary setup).\nCurrency formats are associated with a trigger that can be entered as a\ndictionary definition. To use triggers, write a number and add an additional stroke, the\ntrigger, for the defined currency.\nAn entry in the Currency setup field consists of a single line with six parts.\nEach part is separated by a forward slash. You can add a new currency format by\ntyping on an empty line, or you can edit an existing format.\nThe first part of the format is a capital letter that is added to the standard\ndictionary entry, {#M}, to specify the specific currency format. For example, a\ndictionary stroke defined as {#MD} would indicate the currency format for dollars,\nand a stroke defined as {#MC} would indicate the currency format for cents. NOTE: If\nyou define a dictionary entry as just {#M}, Eclipse will use the first template entry in\nthe \"Currency setup\" field to translate the number.\nThe second and third parts of the format are the singular and plural forms of the\ncurrency. You may create dictionary entries from these monetary units by preceding\nthem with {C:, e.g. {C:Euro} or {C:yen}. The name of the currency must be an exact\nmatch. This dictionary entry type differs from {#MC} type entries in that it will also\ninsert the name of the currency.\nThe fourth part of the format is the currencyâs symbol. Place a carat (^) before\nthe symbol to indicate that the symbol follows the number. Place a carat (^) after the\nsymbol to indicate that the symbol precedes the number.\nThe fifth part of the format indicates whether the currency is a primary unit and\nwhether secondary units are diplayed as decimal values. For example, the U.S. dollar\nhas a value of 1.0 because it is the primary unit of currency and its secondary units\n(cents) are displayed as a decimal. The cent has a value of 0.01 because it is a\nsecondary unit equal to one-hundreth (0.01) of a the primary currency unit. A primary\ncurrency unit without (common) secondary units, such as Japanâs Yen, would have\nthe value of 1 (no decimal).\nReference Guide 825\nThe sixth part of the format is an exclamation point (!) that is either present or\nabsent. When the exclamation point is included, it indicates that the specified\ncurrency is terminal â no additional currency units can appear. That means the\nnumber conversion will stop accepting new numbers at the point where this type of\ncurrency is indicated. For example, the dollar is not terminal because it may be\nfollowed by a cents value -- when you write \"dollars\" the number conversion still\nneeds to wait and see if you write any additional numbers for cents. The cent is\nterminal because no numbers representing money may follow a cents value. Likewise,\nthe Yen is terminal -- If you write the word \"yen\" it will translate the number without\nadding anything to it.\nThe dollars and cents currency formats look like this:\nD/dollar/dollars/$^/1.0\nC/cent/cents/^ cents/0.01/!\nHere is a breakdown of the first example:\nD - Capital letter that is added to the standard dictionary entry, {#M}, to indicate\nthe specific currency format. Using the above example, a stroke defined in the\ndictionary as {#MD} would indicate the currency format for dollars. NOTE: If you\ndefine a dictionary entry as just {#M}, Eclipse will use the first template entry in the\nCurrency setup field to translate the number.\ndollar - Singular form of the currency\ndollars - Plural form of the currency\n$^ - Symbol for the particular currency. The carat (^) indicates where the number is\nin relation to the currency symbol. If the symbol follows the number, place the carat\n(^) before the symbol. If the symbol precedes the number, (as in $1.00) place the\ncarat after the symbol\n1.0 - Indicates if the currency is a primary unit and if secondary units are displayed\nas decimal values. For example, the U.S. dollar has a value of 1.0 because it is the\nprimary unit of currency and its secondary units (cents) are displayed as a decimal.\nTo indicate a cent, which is not a primary unit and wouldnât have secondary units\npresented as decimals, enter 0.01. A primary currency unit without (common)\nsecondary units, such as Japanâs Yen, is entered as 1 (no decimal)\nAn exclamation at the end of the line (shown in the second example above -\nC/cent...) indicates that the specified currency is terminalâno additional currency\nunits can appear. For example the dollar is not terminal because it may be followed by\na cents value. The cent is terminal because no numbers representing money would\nfollow a cents value. Likewise, the Yen is terminal.\nNote: if you prefer turning \"five cents\" into $0.05 or $.05, you can accomplish this by\nsetting the cents symbol to $0.^ or $.\n826 Eclipse Help\n22.17 Programming Tab of User Settings\nProgramming Tab of User Settings\nOn the User settings/Programming tab you will find settings for advanced\ncustomization of Eclipse. They are listed in alphabetical order.\nAll lists on the Programming tab open in windows that can be resized and\nzoomed to view more of the items on the list. You can search for text within the list\nusing the Find button, and Ctrl+L to move to the next instance.\nWith a list open, press the Add button to make a whole new item.\nPress the Modify button, or hit Enter, to edit the item the cursor is on.

The default list contains many common words which will not be\nused when creating auto-briefs.\n500\n829\n826\nReference Guide 829\nOne exception to this is that words on the User settings/Translate tab/Noncapping\nwords list (that should not be capitalized when title case is used, e.g., \"in\"\nas in Alice in Wonderland) will be permitted in phrases, even if they appear on the\nineligible words list, as long as they are not the first or last word in the phrase.\nYou can add additional words that you would like auto-brief to skip, or delete\nwords from the list if you would like them to appear in your auto-briefs.\n22.17.2 Auto-brief Steno Theory\nAuto-Brief Steno Theory\nRELATES TO: Auto-brief , Auto-brief\nIneligible .\nIn the User Settings/Programming tab there is an item called Auto-brief\nsteno theory.\nIf there are certain combinations of keys you never want to see in an auto-brief,\nor particular keys you want briefs always to contain, select \"Modify\" to put that\ncombination of keys on the list.\n500\n828\n830 Eclipse Help\nYou can use the \"Add\" and \"Modify\" buttons in this dialog rather than typing\nthe rules from scratch.\nReference Guide 831\nYou will be given a choice between the following three options:\nProhibited key combination â select a sequence of keys that should never\nappear in a brief because it's too difficult to hit with your particular keyboard\nconfiguration (for example, -TD without wide keys.)\nRequired keys â select a key or keys that will be added to every auto-brief. For\nexample, if you want all briefs to contain an asterisk, put * in the stroke here.\nPre-made stroke â If you want the auto-brief feature to use arbitrary pre-made\nbrief strokes from a list rather than to come up with sound-alikes, use this option to\ncreate those pre-made strokes. Note that this feature is primarily for voicewriters who\ncannot speak untrained words on the fly and must pre-program temporary voice\ncodes in advance.\nProhibited key combinations\nYou can disallow as many combinations of keys as you like by placing a minus\nsign before them. For example, your list might contain the following:\n-*\n-TD\n-TSD\n-SZ\n-SDZ\nThis list disallows ANY stroke containing an asterisk at all if you don't like the\nasterisk suggestions. For users without wide -DZ keys on the steno keyboard, this\nalso disallows any stroke containing the D or Z and the key immediately to the left of\nit.\nAnother use for this feature: If you put \"- \" (minus and space, without the\nquotes) then you are disallowing any steno sequence that contains a space. In other\nwords, you are disallowing the double-stroke briefs that the auto-brief system\nsometimes has to use.\nNote that if you disallow too much, the system may want to give you a brief for\nsomething but may be unable to do so. You can remedy that situation by using the\nnext two features of this option set.\nRequired keys\nIf you ALWAYS want auto-briefs to contain a particular set of keys, you can put a\nline in this area with a + sign before it. The steno keys you enter will then be added\nto ALL auto-brief entries that the system creates.\nFor example, if you ONLY wanted the suggestions with the asterisk, you could\nuse:\n+*\nIf you used a special suffix for briefs, such as -DZ, you could put in\n832 Eclipse Help\n+-DZ\nSo when the system was looking for a brief for Hofstadter, it would try H-DZ,\nthen HO-DZ, etc.\nNote that these keys may not end up being consecutive in the final brief. For\nexample, if you have\n+*Z\nThen you may get a brief like PWA*RZ for a word like \"Bartholemew.\" The + line\nsimply adds the keys indicated to any auto-brief stroke.\nNote that you can only have ONE line with a plus sign, because it will add those\nkeys to ALL auto-briefs that it creates, so it wouldn't make sense to have multiples. If\nyou want multiple keys, just include them all on that one line.\nPre-made strokes: Auto-brief can supply steno from a pre-defined\nlist\nYou can include as many lines as you like of pre-defined steno using the = sign.\nFor example:\n=1-BL\n=2-BL\n=3-BL\netc.\nIf the system is unable to come up with a brief that fits the specified criteria and\nis not already being used in a dictionary, it will use the first available item from this\nlist. If the - and + restrictions result in the system's being unable to find a brief\nstroke that it can use, it will look for the first = stroke that is available.\nIf you only want it to use these pre-defined items for briefs and to never try to\ncome up with its own, then there is a simple way to disallow all strokes:\n-\nThat's a line with a single minus sign and NOTHING after it. This command\ndisallows all strokes by default, which means that all auto-briefs must be generated\nonly from the pre-defined steno offered on the lines starting with =\nSo a sample theory list might be:\n-\n=1-BL\n=2-BL\n=3-BL\nReference Guide 833\nWhich means to disallow all automated stroke generation and use only the three\nstrokes provided. Once those are used up, no more auto-briefs will be created, which\nis a good argument for offering quite a few default strokes ahead of time if you're\ngoing to use this technique.\nAsk for another brief, and use the rules for alternates\nThe +STENO syntax of the auto-brief rules is useful to force the use of\nalternates. If you have multiple +STENO lines, such as:\n+OEUG\n+OEUB\n+OEUZ\nThen the first suggestion for any auto-brief word or phrase will add the steno\nfrom the first + line; so you might write âstenographicallyâ in five strokes and get\nSOEUG as a suggestion.\nIf you use {ABNEW} to ask for a new suggestion for that word, it will rotate to\nthe next line, suggesting SOEUB instead. Hitting {ABNEW} again rotates to the next\nline, etc.\nAuto-briefs and numbers\nYou can optionally add a sequence of steno keys that will ONLY be added to autobriefs\ncontaining numbers. This is indicated by including the number sign # after the\n+ sign.\nFor example, you might add +#SZ in the auto-brief steno theory. Then, when\nyou write 574,974.23, the auto-brief procedure will be able to suggest 5SZ as a brief\nfor that number.\nNote that the number additions and the regular additions are separate,\nindependent settings and you can use only one or only the other or both\nsimultaneously.\nAuto-briefs containing numbers such as dates: \"May 12, 2007\"\nIf you have the numbers enabled in the auto-brief function, AND you remove the\nmonths from the list of auto-brief ineligible words found under User\nsettings/Programming, then dates in this format will end up with a brief suggested\nfor them.\nYou may or may not find this useful, depending on the circumstances and the\ntypes of jobs you do, so experiment and decide what works for you.\nVISUALIZERS:\nE3-Auto-Brief Customization\nE3-Auto-Brief during Realtime Translation\n834 Eclipse Help\n22.17.3 Autoreplacments\nAutoreplacements\nRELATES TO: Programming tab .\nAn autoreplacement is a piece of text that is automatically substituted for\nanother piece of text during editing. They can be used to address common\ntypographical errors, or to create fast ways to type long phrases. This list consists of\ntwo text strings that are separated by an equal sign. When the string on the left is\ntyped in a document, Eclipse automatically replaces it with the string on the right. For\nexample, the entry, \"adn=and\" would automatically correct \"adn\" with \"and\". Another\nway to use autoreplacements is to create abbreviations that make typing more\nefficient (e.g. DOJ=Department of Justice).\nThe syntax for an Autoreplacement entry is:\nword=replacement\nSome sample autoreplacement entries:\nWhenever you type what is on the left-hand side of the equals sign, it will be\nautomatically replaced by whatever is on the right. For example, if you type \"adn\", it\nwill automatically be changed to \"and.\"\n826\nReference Guide 835\nTo create an autoreplacement, simply type it into the list, using the\nword=replacement syntax. You may also delete or edit autoreplacements, just by\nediting the list as text.\nThe list of autoreplacements is automatically sorted alphabetically. You do not\nhave to put new autoreplacements in their precise location; you can place new entries\nanywhere you like, as long as the word=replacement syntax is followed for each\nindividual entry, .\nAutoreplacements can also be created during globaling . To do this, type the\nautoreplacements text into the globaling window. For example, if you type \"teh=the\"\nin the globaling window, you will be asked if you want to create an autoreplacement\nof \"teh=the\". If this global is to go into a dictionary, the dictionary entry will be\ncreated of just the word \"the.\"\nPartial Autoreplacements\nSome common typing errors are not whole words like âhteâ which should be\nâtheâ but are instead parts of words, like prefixes and suffixes. So, you can enter\nprefixes and suffixes on the auto-replacement list by using the * symbol as a\nwildcard.\nFor example the following auto-replacement:\n*toin=tion\nindicates that if you type âtoinâ at the end of any word, it will be changed to\nâtionâ instead.\nJob-specific autoreplacements\nIf you wish to have autoreplacements that only work in the current document,\nrather than being a permanent part of the user settings forever, you can add them to\nthe current job only.\nTo add an autoreplacement for the current job, add a line to Tools/Job\nvariables as follows:\nAUTOREP=orig1=replacement1|orig2=replacement2|orig3=replacement3\nSo, for example, you might put\nAUTOREP=lb=lithium-ion battery|tx=Texas Instruments, Inc.\nUsing The Dialog To Make Changes\nTo create new entries in this list or edit existing ones, you may edit the text\ndirectly in the window, or you can click Add or Modify to open the Text substitution\ndialog that will prompt you for the necessary information:\n326\n836 Eclipse Help\nEnter the text you want to replace into the Original Text box.

A location type selection window appears. Select the label you would\nlike to use or select Create new location to create a customized location name.\nAfter selecting the label you'll be prompted to browse to location you want the\nshortcut to look at.\nReference Guide 841\nFor example, if you wanted to add an autoblock folder, you would hit Add, then\nselect AUTOBLOCK. You could also select [Create new location] and type something\nyou make up such as ARCHIVE or PORTABLE and then hit [enter]. Then select or\ncreate the folder in the folder dialog and hit Ok, at which point it would create\nAUTOBLOCK={JOB}autoblock\nYou can use the Make New Folder button to create the new folder ahead of\ntime in addition to being able to select existing folders.\nThe syntax for the File locations is as follows: TYPE={OptionalParent}path\nFor example, a basic user setup might look like this:\nMAIN={DOC}Eclipse\nJOB={MAIN}Joe\nBLOCK={JOB}Blocks\n842 Eclipse Help\nThe MAIN folder is where all user.ini files are stored, for the entire Eclipse\ninstallation. If you change this, it changes for everyone who uses Eclipse on this\ncomputer, because it tells Eclipse where to find the .ini files when the program first\nruns. If you set it (or leave it) as MAIN={DOC}, Eclipse will find the files for\nwhichever Windows user is logged in in a multiuser system.\nThe JOB folder reads {MAIN}Joe, so when Eclipse needs to access a file in the\nJobs folder, that will expand to C:\\Users\\Username\\Documents\\Eclipse\\Joe\nLikewise, the BLOCK folder first expands from {JOB}Blocks to {MAIN}Joe\\Blocks,\nthen to C:\\Users\\Username\\Documents\\Eclipse\\Joe\\Blocks\nNote that this hierarchical structure is only apparent to advanced users working\nin the User settings/Programming/File locations area.\nYou can also view and modify these paths in the User settings/User/Advanced\nsection where the path names appear and you can hit a button to browse through\nfolders. Though this dialog shows the entire path name, it's actually accessing and\nmodifying the file locations when you use it.\nLikewise, anywhere in the program where you're browsing for a folder (such as\nselecting the location where you read files from your writer) and/or selecting a file\nfrom a different location than the jobs folder, the system may automatically create an\nentry under the File locations in order to account for this new user preference.\nAll file names and locations are stored as part of this system. For example, the\nuser spelling dictionary is stored as UserName.esp and is expected to appear in the\njobs folder as specified by the JOB= line. You can change things such as the location\nwhere your files are stores, or the name of your jobs folder, or even your entire main\nfolder, in just one location, making it simple to move everything, for example, to My\nDocuments\\ Eclipse.\nMany optional file locations can be specified. For example, having a BLOCK folder\nis helpful, but you can subdivide even further by specifying a LIST folder (for list files\nused for form fields) and an INCLUDE folder (for autoinclude dictionary entries and\nthe translator's initial and final block settings.)\nNote that you can use {DESKTOP} in the File Locations feature, so you can\ncreate folders such as EXPORT={DESKTOP}scopist\\RTF files.\nThese categories are optional; the way that the system works is this:\nWhen it translates an autoinclude such as {<cover}, Eclipse will first look to see if\nyou have an INCLUDE folder specified. If not, it will see if you have a BLOCK folder\nspecified. If not, it will finally look in your JOB folder for the cover.ecl file to include\ninto the document. (Note that even the BLOCK folder is optional, and without it,\nEclipse expects everything to be in the JOB folder.)\nReference Guide 843\nNote that these folders don't need to be inside each other, such as\n(...Users\\Joe\\Block\\Include). INCLUDE could be C:\\Eclipse\\Include, BLOCK could be\n{MAIN}Block, JOB could be {MAIN}Joe\\Transcripts. Eclipse doesn't care. The point is\nthat you do not need to have a BLOCK or INCLUDE folder if you don't want them.\nTechnically even the JOB folder is optional. As a last resort, Eclipse will create and\nlook for files in the MAIN folder if no other folders are specified, but you would\nprobably not want every Eclipse file for every user in one folder.\nYou do not need to use every optional path. Some are only applicable to specific\nneeds. For example, a scopist might want to play WAV files directly off CDs they get\nfrom reporters. A reporting firm might put all of their form lists for all reporters in a\ncentral repository on the network, etc.\nAlthough you can put your note files, transcript files and dictionaries in three\ndifferent places, if you do, you lose the job file hierarchy integration provided by the\nEclipse file manager. If you keep them all in the same folder, you can easily look at all\nyour dictionaries at once by using Windows explorer in the detail view and sorting by\nfile type.\nHere is a complete list of the different optional file locations supported by\nEclipse:\nUSER\nThis is where UserName.ini files will be loaded and stored once you've entered\nyour particular user setup. Normally these are found in MAIN and it's not a good idea\nto change this. The only application for this is a shared system in which you have, for\nexample, 10 users, each with 20 different .ini files. Each user can have his or her own\nfolder for their .ini file variations and just keep the main .ini file in the MAIN folder so\nthat the initial Eclipse login doesn't end up with 200 .ini files to scroll through.\nJOB\nThis is the default location for most files, and is the only location where\nTranscript.ecl files are found.\nPROG\nThis is the location where the program itself is stored.\nDOC\nThis allows you direct access to your documents folder. For example, if you\nwanted your Eclipse documents to go in a folder named \"Eclipse\" as a subfolder of\nyour \"My Documents\" folder in XP (or your \"Documents\" folder in Windows 7) you\nwould use:\nMAIN={DOC}Eclipse\nThat way, if your jobs folder is\nJOB={MAIN}Bob\nthen your job files would be in My Documents\\Eclipse\\Bob\nBLOCK ( -> JOB )\nBlock files are, broadly, any .ecl file that is used for some purpose other than\nbeing a complete transcript.\n844 Eclipse Help\nBLOCKREAD ( -> BLOCK -> JOB ) The location for the Block/Read (Alt+R)\nfunction if you have a need for that to be different from the BLOCK folder.\nINCLUDE ( -> BLOCKREAD -> BLOCK -> JOB )\nWhere Eclipse will find autoinclude files for {<filename} dictionary entries and\nthe Translate/Initial and final block settings.\nLIST ( -> BLOCKREAD -> BLOCK -> LIST )\nThe location for list files used by form fields that provide lists of choices.\nBLOCKWRITE ( -> JOB )\nThe location for the Block/Write and Block/Separate functions for writing blocks\nout from the current file.

For\nexample, if you wanted WAV files to record in the JOB folder, but to play them back\nfrom the network or a CD, you could simply have:\nJOB={MAIN}Joe\nWAVPLAY=F:\\Audio\nYou do not need a WAV setting just because you have a WAVPLAY setting.\nNOT ( -> JOB )\nReference Guide 845\nThe default location for note files.\nDIX ( -> JOB )\nThe default location for dictionary files.\nDIXMAIN ( -> DIX -> JOB )\nThe location of your main dictionary.\nDIXJOB ( -> DIX -> JOB )\nThe location of the job dictionary for the current job.

Whenever you perform a global, you may be offered suggestions of other\nforms of the word, with final-side keystrokes like -D, -G, and -S included for\n^ed, ^ing, and ^s endings. For example, if you global PHARBG as \"mark\",\nyou may be offered PHARBGD and PHARBGS for \"marked\" and \"marks.\"\nThe Integral prefix and suffix steno definitions table in the User\nsettings/Programming tab allows you to customize the suggestions you\nreceive. When you create a user, it will have a default set; you need only edit\nthis table if you wish to alter the suggestions, or create new ones.\nThe syntax for an entry in this table is:\nwordpart=NewStenoKeys,ExistingStenoCheck\nWordpart is simply the prefix or suffix this entry represents. It takes the\nsame syntax as prefix/suffix dictionary entries : ^ed, ^s, pre^, etc.\nNewStenoKeys are the keys that are added to the outline. A final D\nwould be -D, final S would be -S, the prefix dis^ would be STK, etc. Finalside\nkeys should be preceded with a hyphen (otherwise the system will think\nthey are initial-side keys).\nThe ExistingStenoCheck is the most complicated part of the entry, and\nhas two components: Inclusive Steno and Exclusive Steno.\nThe + sign indicates that the presence of the letters specified is\nREQUIRED. The lack of a plus sign indicates that the presence of the letters\nspecified is PROHIBITED.\nExclusive Steno is preceded by a minus sign, and indicates keys that\nmust not be part of the stroke. For example:\n826\n333\n333\n960\nReference Guide 847\nThis entry -DZ means that for -D to be suggested as an ^ed ending, the\nkeys -D and -Z must not be present in the stroke. The -DZ is Exclusive\nSteno.\nExclusive steno applies to suffixes or prefixes that should NOT be\napplied if certain letters are already in the stroke. For example, you should\nNOT apply a -G = ^ing if there is already an -S in the stroke.\nThat's why the ^ing entry looks like this:\n^ing=-G,-GTSDZ\nThat means as long as NONE of the letters -GTSDZ are in the stroke, it's OK\nto add the -G and ^ing to the end. That's the EXCLUSIVE steno.\nThere is also Inclusive Steno. This is preceded by a plus sign, and\nindicates keys that must be present in the stroke. For example, here is the\nentry for the final Z:\nThe +-D means that final D must already be a part of the stroke, or this\nentry will not be offered as a suggestion. The -D is Inclusive Steno.\nInclusive steno applies to suffixes or prefixes which should be applied\nONLY if certain letters are already in the stroke. For example, in the tucked-in\n{^er}, users want to be able to specify that they ONLY tuck in an -R before\nthe letters G, T, S or D\nThat's why the ^er entry looks like this:\n^er=-R,+-GTSD\nNOTE: If the ExistingStenoCheck part of an entry contains a plus sign\nand a minus sign in order, such as the previous example, it means that this\nis an Inclusive Steno item that contains final-side keys. The entry +-D means\n\"inclusive steno for final D\".\nHere is the integral prefix/suffix table which is included in the eclipse.set\ndefault settings file. You may remove the ones you don't use.\n^ed=-D,-DZ\n^ing=-G,-GTSDZ\n^s=-S,-SDZ\n^s=-Z,+-D\n^er=-R,+-GTSD\ndis^=STK-,STK848\nEclipse Help\nUsing The Dialog To Make Changes\nTo create new entries in this list or edit existing ones, you may edit the\ntext directly in the window, or you can click Add or Modify to open a dialog\nthat will prompt you for the necessary information:\nSelect Suggest This Prefix or Suggest This Suffix, depending on\nwhich one you want Eclipse to suggest.\nThe Steno button will open the Steno Emulator , in which you can\nselect the key(s) on the steno keyboard that are used to include this suffix in\na stroke, such as -G for \"ing\".\nThe Keys button will open the Steno Emulator , in which you can\nindicate which keys on the keyboard should or should not be present in order\nto make it a valid suggestion.\nSelect None Are Present or At Least One Is Present to instruct the\nsystem whether or not the keystrokes you entered via the Keys button are\nrequired or prohibited. For example, the system should probably not suggest\n-G for \"ing\" if -S is already present, because -GS is usually a \"tion\" ending.\nLikewise, you may want to define that -Z can be used to represent {^s}, but\nonly if the -D is present.\nIn another example, ^s=-Z,+-D indicates that the -Z should be\nsuggested to add an {^s} ending to the stroke ONLY if there is already a -D\nin the stroke. That's because if there's not a -D, most users would tuck in an\n-S, not a -Z. If you ALWAYS want the system to suggest -Z as a possible\n{^s} ending, just change it to ^s=-Z,-Z (always suggest unless there's\nalready a -Z in the stroke).\nEnforcing a particular order\nThe prefix/suffix permission strings can be setup to enforce a particular\norder. In some cases (especially for some non-English languages like Italian)\nthe permission strings in the prefix/suffix table are not quite specific enough.\n893\n893\nReference Guide 849\nFor example, the ^^[eds]ing entry can turn âwalkedâ into âwalkingâ or\nâtaxesâ into âtaxingâ by virtue of the fact that the last two letters in the\noriginal word are either e, d or s.\nHowever, that rule would also turn âscaldsâ into âscalingâ because again, the\noriginal word ends in two letters belonging to the set [eds]. If you would like\nto specify a particular sequence of specific letters, you can do so by using the\nfollowing syntax: ^^[=sequence]suffix. For example, after adding ^^[=ed]\ning,^^[=es]ing, Eclipse only has permission to modify words that specifically\nend in âedâ or âesâ.\nIn addition to fine-tuning anyoneâs personal steno theory, this is also an\naccessible feature for non-English or non-stenographic keyboards and\ntheories.\nSuffixes can delete the previouswordwhen applying variations\nYou might have a suffix with a long deletion command, such as\n^able=able,&able,^able,^^^^able (in which the fourth entry is designed to\nbe able to remove an existing suffix to turn, for example, \"remarkably\" to\n\"remarkable\")\nWhen you have a string of multiple deletes like this, you can remove the\nentire word, but no more than that. Since an empty string is considered a\nvalid spelling, it is possible to create a dictionary entry like so:\n{^D}\nAnd a prefix/suffix table entry like so:\n^D=^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nNote that the number of ^ characters is arbitrary. It's the length of the\nlargest word you think you might want to delete.\nThe first use of this entry is that, unlike {DELETE} which removes the\nprevious stroke, {^D} removes the previous word, no matter how many\nstrokes it is. Now, since it removes the word and not the space before it,\nyou'll want to make the dictionary entry {^D}{^} so that it removes the extra\nspace that would appear when you write the new word.\nNow, while it's possible to write a macro that goes back and removes the\nprevious word by using the word left and delete word functions, it's not\ndesirable, because it only removes it from the editing, so it would not affect\nclosed captioning displays, CIC output, or any other realtime data\ntransmission method. But the {^D} solution does apply to your outputs,\nmaking it a vastly superior technique for deleting a word as opposed to a\nstroke.\nThis technique can also be used within macros using the Force translation\nfunction. For example, a typical macro to back up and capitalize the previous\nword has no effect on CIC screens, but if written as follows:\nWord left\nBlock mark\nCopy\n850 Eclipse Help\nForce translation\nCtrl+V to paste\nCtrl+K to capitalize\nHome\n{^D}{^}\n[enter]\nThis macro will grab the previous word and force a new translation which\nremoves the previous word and replaces it with a capitalized version of the\nsame word. If you like macros, experiment with this technique and see if you\ncan find other ways that editing commands in macros can be used to\nimprove translation even when outputting to CIC or captioning.\n22.17.9 Metadictionary\nMetadictionary\nRELATES TO: Metadictionary Syntax and\nCodes , Programming tab.\nThe metadictionary is the set of rules that dictates how dictionary entries behave.\nIt can be used to create custom functionality for dictionary entries.\nWARNING: If you are an inexperienced user, you should not attempt to edit\nthe following without expert guidance.\nThe metadictionary contains entries with complex dictionary formatting, which\nsimplify the entries you make in standard dictionaries by specifying how special terms\n(e.g. months, measurements, numbers, and functions) are to be translated.\nWhen you choose Modify, the Metadictionary entry dialog opens, which allows you\nto develop or edit metadictionary entries without worrying about the complicated syntax,\nwhich is handled for you. (For a detailed explanation of the Metadictionary syntax and\ncodes, see Metadictionary Syntax and Codes. )\n797 826\n797\nReference Guide 851\nThe default user setup contains a great many common metadictionary entries,\nwhich provide the functionality for common dictionary entries . Any new entries\nyou may need for special tasks, such as captioning, are typically created by\nAdvantage Software and distributed in (and often included in .SET files ). So most\nusers will not need to edit metadictionary entries.\nThe syntax for a metadictionary entry is:\ndictionary entry=metadictionary rule\nThe Dictionary Entry, the part left of the equals sign, is what goes in your steno\ndictionary. This can be an ordinary word, like \"August\", \"mile\" or \"twenty-seven\", or it\ncan be a bracketed entry such as {Q}\nThe Metadictionary Rule consists of one or more metadictionary items. A\nmetadictionary item can be something as simple as {/\"%/?TTL} which indicates that\nthe dictionary entry is a title, or it can be a complex series of marks that controls\nadvanced punctuation behavior.\n958\n102\n852 Eclipse Help\nSome metadictionary syntax examples are given below. The examples use codes\nand techniques you are most likely to need in creating custom entries. There are more\ncodes available; however, these are for tasks where ordinary dictionary syntax is\nadequate (such as prefixes and suffixes), or for highly specialized tasks (such as\ngender of nouns in languages other than English). If you need to create a custom\nentry, please contact Advantage Software tech support for guidance.\nText Commands\nThe simplest metadictionary command is a text command. This command simply\ninserts the specified text. This is commonly used in entries where you want the word\nitself to appear, such as \"January\". The syntax for a text command is:\n{/\"text}\nText is the text you want to appear. For example, here is the default\nmetadictionary entry for \"January\":\nThe command {/\"January} inserts the word. You may also use the code {/\"%},\nwhich will insert the text that appears to the left of the equals sign:\nContext Codes\nThe /?NUM and /?PMT from the previous examples are context codes. These\ncodes tell Eclipse the nature of a piece of text. With the exception of NUM and PGH,\nthese are usually included in a text command, like the \"miles\" example above.\nThe syntax for a context code is:\n/?ABC\nwhere ABC is the context code.\nHere is a list of commonly-used context codes:\nÂ· TXT - ordinary text.\nÂ· TTL - a title, such as Dr. or Mrs. - will automatically attach to and capitalize the\nword that follows.\nÂ· SMT and PMT - singular and plural measurements, respectively.\nÂ· PGH - inserts a paragraph of the specified type. You must name the type in a text\ncommand, like this:\n{C}={/\"Centered/?PGH}\nÂ· NUM - performs a number conversion of the specified type. You must name the\ntype in a text command, with a one-letter code. These are the same codes that are\nused in number conversion . For example, here is the metadictionary entry for\no'clock:\n684\nReference Guide 853\no'clock={/\"T/?NUM}{/\"o'clock}\nThe code {/\"T/?NUM} converts the preceding number to a time. (This saves you\nhaving to put {#T} in the dictionary entry.)\nÂ· TPC, CPC, and DPC indicate terminal punctuation, comma punctuation, and dash\npunctuation, respectively. When creating new punctuation marks, use these codes\nat the end of the entry to indicate how the mark should behave.\nÂ· TGE indicates a toggling entry. Use this code to create an entry that will alternate\nbetween two things. The syntax is:\n{/\"first item/'second item/?TGE}\nFor example, here is the default entry that toggles between opening and closing\nparentheses:\n{(}={/\"(/')/?TGE}\nFor a complete list of context codes, see the Entry Type list in the\nAdd/Modify dialog .\nBehavior Commands\nBehavior commands are most often used with punctuation marks. They control\ncapitalization, spacing, and other actions.\n/< followed by text means \"this text should precede this entry.\" It is most\ncommonly used without any following text, to mean that there should be nothing\nbefore this entry. (In other words, delete the space.)\n/> followed by text means \"this text should follow this entry.\" This is most\ncommonly used to delete or add spaces after an entry.\n^ will delete one character.\n/|> capitalizes the next word.\n/|< capitalizes the previous word.\n/|- allows capitalization for the prior entry to carry through to the next entry. In\nother words, if the prior entry told the next word to capitalize, then this entry will\npass that through and capitalize the next entry.\nSquare brackets [] indicate things that this entry can replace. For example, the\ndefault period {.} metadictionary entry contains this section:\n[,;-:?~]\nThis means that the period can replace a comma, semi-colon, dash, colon,\nquestion mark, or tilde (lock-space). Add or remove entries from within the brackets\nto determine \"replacement rights\" for this mark.\n855\n854\n854 Eclipse Help\nUsing The Dialog To Make Changes\nTo create new entries in this list or edit existing ones, you may edit the text\ndirectly in the window, or you can click Add or Modify to open a dialog that will\nprompt you for the necessary information:\nThe Original text box is where you type the original text that gets replaced with\nthe metasyntax.\nSelect Text or Command to indicate whether the original text is a command or\nnot. For example, the word \"dollars\" is simply a piece of text in the metadictionary\nthat's defined as currency. The {Q} is a command that acts as a question paragraph.\nIf you are entering a command, you do not need to type the braces. You would type\nsimply a Q into the Original box, not {Q}. The braces are added for you when this\ndialog makes the final entry.\nWhen preparing the original text, the Add wildcard button will tell the system\nwhere some variation is allowed in what the actual dictionary entries look like. It's the\nsame as typing a * symbol. For example, in the speaker entry S:*, the * indicates\nthat the speaker name can be anything. It will still count as a match, and the\nappropriate metasyntax will be applied.\nReference Guide 855\nIf your metadictionary rule contains more than one metadictionary item, as\nexplained previously, the Replacement Listing Of Commands will list them in\norder. In the above graphic, there are two metadictionary items: ={/\"October} inserts\nthe word \"October\", and {/\"N/?NUM} applies a number trigger that changes the\nfollowing number to numerals.\nTo change the order of the entries in the Replacement Listing of Commands,\nselect the entry you wish to move, and then click Move Up or Move Down.\nThe Delete button will delete the selected metadictionary item.\nThe Add button will add a new metadictionary item. When adding, click the\n\"Add\" button first, then change the parameters in the Current Replacement\nCommand group below. Select the command you wish to change and then make\nmodifications in these controls.\nSelect the desired context code from the Entry Type list. If you choose an item\nthat requires a specific syntax for the text of the meta-entry, an additional dialog will\nappear. For example, if you pick \"PGH\" for paragraph type, it will give you a list of\nparagraphs to choose from, and will add the paragraph name you choose to the\nmetadictionary entry.\nThe list box for Left Boundary allows you to control the boundary text. Boundary\ntext is the text that appears before or after an entry, but doesn't count as part of the\nentry itself. Your options are:\nÂ· Default Left Boundary will leave the boundary at the default, which is normally a\nspace.\nÂ· Delete Left Boundary Text will delete the boundary, such as for punctuation\nwhich needs to attach to the previous text (delete left) or text that follows (delete\nright).\nÂ· Force Left Boundary Text will force the boundary to be whatever text you type\ninto the box immediately to the right of the drop-down list.\nIf you are using Delete Left Boundary option, Delete Up To... Characters allows\nyou to remove some of the previous entry before applying the current one. For\nexample, a period might be permitted to delete a comma that comes before it. Enter\nthe maximum number of characters to delete into the Delete Up To... Characters box.\nIf you want to delete some characters but not others, enter the characters that are\nallowed to be deleted into the text box to the left of Delete Up To... Characters.\nThe Text box is where you enter the text of the metadictionary entry. Usually,\nthis is what actually translates. However, some special entry types use this box for\nfurther code. For example, with paragraph and font entries, this is the paragraph\nname or the font name.\nThe Use Wildcard button will insert a % character into the Text box. If you are\nusing a wildcard in the original text, the % sign will represent the same text that *\nrepresents in the original. For example, For example, the original is (S:*) and the text\nis (Speaker:%). Whatever replaces * in the dictionary entry will be used in place of\nthe % sign in the resulting paragraph label.\n856 Eclipse Help\nIf the original entry does not have a wildcard symbol in it, the % symbol\nrepresents the entire original entry. For example, if the original text is \"October\",\nputting a % symbol in the Text box will insert the word \"October\".\nThe Lockspace button types a lockspace into the Text box. It's the same as\ntyping a tilde ~\nIf you are using the TGE (toggle) command code, enter the alternate text into\nthe Alternate Text box. For example, the entry that toggles between an open paren\nand a closed paren would have ( in the Text box, ) in the Alternate Text box, and TGE\nselected in the Entry Type.\nUse Previous Right Boundary applies to right boundaries only, and will use\nwhatever the right boundary of the previous entry was. For example, a quote entry\nshould probably use the previous right boundary. If the previous entry was a\nterminal period, the quote would be followed by two spaces. If the previous entry\nwas a regular word, it will be followed by one space.\nThe Add condition button allows you add conditions to the Text box. The text\nbox may can contain conditions describing what text to translate, based on the text\nthat comes before it. To add a condition to the text, fill in the following boxes first,\nand then press the \"Add condition\" button:\nÂ· If Preceded By: The condition must specify what text must precede the entry in\norder for the specific text to be translated. If you always want the replacement text\nto be used, leave this blank.\nÂ· Translate As: The text that should translate only if the conditional text is present.\nFor example, if you were creating a .) entry you might want it to check if there's\nalready a period there. If there is, translate only the ) symbol, but if there is not,\ntranslate .) entirely. To do this, put \"preceded by: .\" \"Translate as: )\" and press\n\"Add condition\". Then leave, \"preceded by\" blank, put in \"Translate as: .)\" and press\n\"Add condition\" again.\nÂ· Right Boundary: Offers the same options as the left boundary, plus a fourth\noption: \"Use previous right boundary.\" That means to use whatever the right\nboundary of the previous entry was. For example, a quote entry should probably use\nwhatever the appropriate right boundary for the previous entry was, so if the\nprevious entry was a terminal period, the quote would be followed by two spaces. If\nthe previous entry was a regular word, it will be followed by one space.\nÂ· Left Case Change: Allows you to change the capitalization of the previous word.\nYour choices are Default case, Cap Previous, and Uncap previous.\nÂ· Right Case Change: Allows you to change the capitalization of the following word.\nYou have the same choices as Left Case Change, plus \"Cap Through\" which takes\nthe capitalization instructions from the previous entry and uses them to apply to the\nnext entry without the current one interfering. Like \"Use previous right boundary\",\nthis is useful for quotes, parens and other items that should not interrupt the\ngrammatical flow.\nReference Guide 857\n22.17.10Normalization Table\nNormalization Table\nRELATES TO: Programming Tab, Working\nWith Global Suggestions .\nNormalize Strokes is one of the three types of global suggestions .\nWhenever you perform a multi-stroke global, you may be offered suggestions\nof different ways to divide the strokes. For example, if you global EURB/AOUR\nas \"issuer\", you may also be offered EU/SHAOUR and EURB/SHAOUR. The\nfirst suggestion moves the \"sh\" sound the second stroke of the multi-stroke\noutline; the second suggestion includes it in both strokes.\nThe Normalization Table for Steno Definitions allows you to customize\nthe suggestions you receive. It will suggest them according to your own\npersonalized steno theory. Some reporters double consonants; others don't.\nSome will regularly move certain consonants across stroke boundaries but\nnot others. Some will substitute â-Fâ for â-Sâ in some situations, some won't.\nWhen you create a user, it will have a default set; you need only edit\nthis table if you wish to alter the suggestions, or create new ones.\nThe syntax for an entry in this list is:\nending1/beginning1,ending2/beginning2,ending3/beginning3,en\nding4/beginning4...\nEach entry is a set of endings (for the first stroke) and beginnings (for\nthe second stroke), separated by commas. All possibilities for the same\nsound need to be included in one entry.\nFor example, here is the entry for the \"kr\" sound:\nThis entry has three possible ways of writing the \"kr\" sound:\nSyntax End 1st\nStroke\nStart 2nd\nStroke\nExample\n/KR KR PHA/KRO =\n\"macro\"\nBG/R BG R PHABG/RO =\n\"macro\"\nBG/KR BG KR PHABG/KRO =\n\"macro\"\n826\n333\n333\n858 Eclipse Help\nThese three key arrangements are considered equivalent. If you create a\nglobal containing one of three arrangements, the other two will be\nsuggested.\nThe first entry in the Normalization Table is a divider: it indicates the\nborder between initial- and final-side keys. (On a standard English keyboard,\nthese are the vowels.) So if you are going to add an entry to this list, do not\nmake it the first entry.\nNote that in order for normalization to work, you MUST specify which central\nstroke letters are to be used as boundaries. The vowels make the best\nboundary letters. In order to apply a normalization, BOTH sides of the\nnormalized strokes must be immediately bounded by the boundary letters.\nNote in the above example that there is an âAâ on the left of the normalized\nboundary and an âOâ on the right.\nSo the very first entry in the normalization table MUST be a list of the\nboundary letters, such as AO*EU\nWhy boundaries? Consider the following:\nB/,/PW,B/PW\nThat WILL be applied to RAB/EUT = rabbit, making RA/PWEUT and\nRAB/PWEUT.\nIt will NOT be applied to ARB/EPB = ashen, even though it has âB/â in it;\nAR/PWEPB and ARB/PWEPB wouldn't make sense in this case. Using the\nvowels as boundaries prevents this from happening.\nIt also explains why the normalization table has so many entries that seem\nduplicative; it's why you need both RS/,R/S,RS/S and LS/,L/S,LS/S even\nthough S/,/S,S/S is already on the list. ALL of the consonant combinations\nneed to be explicitly defined.\nThe Normalize function will support double consonants. So, for example, if\nyou make a global of âHRAD/ER = ladderâ the normalize function used to\nsuggest âHRA/TKER = ladderâ as a different way you could write the same\nphonetic equivalent.\nIt will ALSO suggest that the âdâ sound could be doubled, which many\nreporters do, so it will suggest âHRAD/TKER = ladderâ as well.\n22.17.11Phonetics Table\nPhonetics Table\nRELATES TO: Programming tab. 826\nReference Guide 859\nThe phonetics table allows you to customize your phonetics. Any Eclipse task that\nuses phonetics, from viewing steno in Translate mode to guessing a global ,\nwill use the definitions in this table. You can modify your Phonetics table to match\nyour steno theory.\nAs with all items on the Programming tab , you start with a default set of\nphonetics. So you need only edit this list if you want to customize your phonetics, or\ncreate a new set (such as for a new theory, or a language other than English).\nThe Phonetics table entries use the following basic syntax:\nSTENOKEYS=text\nThe simplest possible phonetic line would be something like this:\nTK=d\nIt is necessary to supply a phonetic table line for each individual key, and for\neach distinct key combination that should be treated differently from the keys\nindividually:\nS=s\nT=t\nR=r\nSR=v\nST=st (not necessary, since S and T already make s and t)\nNote that sometimes you have to include a combination in order to resolve an\nambiguity. The Phonetics are processed from left to right, with the longest possible\nmatch being used first.\nTP=f\nTPH=n\nHR=l\nR=r\nWith the above phonetics table, TPHR would appear as \"nr\" and not \"fl\", making\nthe following line necessary:\nTPHR=fl\nThe phonetics table will only make a replacement if the keys in question are\nconsecutive. For example, STR will not see the SR and add a \"v\" to the phonetic\nequivalent. This is a good thing, because there are words that contain \"str\" in them.\n358 332\n826\n860 Eclipse Help\nThe phonetics table is also used in reverse for the steno machine emulator to\nknow what steno keys to use when a key on the computer keyboard is pressed. For\nexample:\nTPH=n\nThis tells the system that when you press the \"n\" key on the computer, the steno\nkeyboard should show TPH. This will only work when the replacement is only a single\ncharacter. For example:\n-RB=sh\nThis item is not used by the keyboard emulator. Pressing \"sh\" will be the same as\npressing the \"s\" and the \"h\" in succession, so it would likely type the left S or the\nright S, then the left H.\nThe fact that only single characters are used by the steno keyboard and that the\nphonetics are processed from beginning to end and from left to right means that you\ncan use two different entries in the table for two different purposes:\nSTPH=sn\nSTPH=?\nThese two entries are used differently. The phonetics processor will use the first\none, and the steno emulator will skip over the first one and use the second one\nbecause the second one contains only one character.\nLikewise, if you have a situation where you have a single-character replacement\nthat you do not wish for the steno emulator to use, you can mark it with an asterisk,\nwhich will not appear in the phonetic translation, and that will prevent the steno\nkeyboard from using it:\n-Z=s*\n-Z=z\nThis is a good example. Some users use the final z as an alternate \"s\" for\npluralizing words that end in -D. The arrangement above still gives you an easy way\nto type a -Z on the keyboard while still using the -Z for an \"s\" in the translation.\nFor a more complex entry, the phonetics table is organized like this:\nSTENO=pronunciation1,pronunciation2,pronunciation3|spelling1,spelling2,spelling3...\nFor example, -GS is -GS=gs,ings,tion,tial|sion,cial. Everything to the right of the |\nsign is an alternate spelling for one of the possible pronunciations.\nHere is the syntax for a more complex entry in the Phonetics table:\nSTENOKEYS=Basic Phonetic|\nIntelligentPhonetic1,IntelligentPhonetic2,IntelligentPhonetic3...\nReference Guide 861\nSTENOKEYS=pronunciation1,pronunciation2,pronunciation3|\nspelling1,spelling2,spelling3\nAs always, final-side keys are preceded by a hyphen. (Initial S is S:. Final S is -\nS.)\nThe Basic Phonetic is the phonetic for this key. Each key can only have one Basic\nPhonetic, so don't worry about spelling: enter a broad spelling of the sound.\nIntelligent Phonetics come into play when you use the Intelligent Phonetic\ntype on the Translate tab . Intelligent phonetics will attempt to spell the word\ncorrectly; it will examine each of the intelligent phonetic rules you have given, and try\nto come up with a correctly-spelled word.\nIf you are using Basic Phonetics on the Translate tab , then the Intelligent\nPhonetic rules in the Phonetics Table will not be used. In fact, they can be omitted.\nA typical phonetics table entry is:\n-PL (final PL) is the steno stroke. The basic phonetic is \"m\". The intelligent\nphonetics are m, mm, ple, pple, and mb, in that order. (Note that intelligent\nphonetics allow for different sound possibilities; some of these are \"m\" sounds and\nothers are \"pl\" sounds.)\nPhonetics and the Steno Emulator\nThe steno emulator uses the phonetics table to determine key combinations.\nFor example, if you press the letter D, it is the Phonetics Table entry TK=d|d that\ngives you the TK combination.\nSome sounds have more than one key combination for writing them; however, in\nthe steno emulator, you don't want both of them coming up. For example, you may\nhave two different ways of writing the \"u\" sound:\nThe \"u\" sound can be written with either the steno key U by itself, or by AOU.\nHowever, when you press the letter U in the steno emulator, you don't want it to\nimmediately suggest the AOU key combination.\nTo control this, include an asterisk at the end of the Basic Phonetic, for any key\ncombination you do not want the steno emulator to use:\n246 244\n244\n893\n862 Eclipse Help\nPlacing an asterisk in the Basic Phonetic portion of the AOU entry will prevent\nthat key combination from being used in the steno emulator, When you press U, you\nwill get only a U. (If you want AOU, enter those keys manually.)\nUsing The Dialog To Make Changes\nTo create new entries in this list or edit existing ones, you may edit the text\ndirectly in the window, or you can click Add or Modify to open a dialog that will\nprompt you for the necessary information:\nClicking the Steno button will open the Steno Emulator , where you can\nenter the steno keys that make up the phonetic element.\nEnter the phonetic text equivalent for the selected steno keys into the Basic\nSpelling text box.\nYou can enter alternate spellings into the Intelligent spellings text box. Enter\nthe various ways that this phonetic element can be spelled, separated by commas.\nFor example, for the steno element TPH, you might take enter \"n,kn,gn\". You must\nhave selected Intelligent Phonetics on the Translate tab for these alternate\nspellings to be used.\nClicking the Add Silent 'E' button will add a silent \"e\" to the intelligent spellings\nif you are providing the spellings for long vowel sounds. This has the same effect as\ntyping a capital \"E\" into the list itself.\nIf the basic phonetic equivalent is a single letter, the Use With Keyboard\ncheckbox controls whether or not this letter is used as a keyboard equivalent for the\nsteno simulator , as explained in the Phonetics and the Steno Emulator\nsection of this page.\n893\n246\n893 861\nReference Guide 863\nTranslation Magic, Global Magic and Phonetics\nThe Translation Magic and Global Magic features have the ability to construct\ncomplex multi-stroke words based on the information in the phonetics table. It can do\nthis based on many different spelling and pronunciation variations for each different\ncombination of keys in the phonetics table. The syntax used for supplying different\nvariations is as follows:\nSTENOKEYS=pronunciation1, pronunciation2,pronunciation3,etc..|spelling1,\nspelling2,spelling3,etc..\nThe different pronunciations are also used for spellings. The difference between\nthe items on the left and the items on the right is that the spelling variations are\nmerely different variations for pronunciations that have already appeared on the left.\nNote: Use the capital E to represent a silent-e to be placed after the next\nconsonant sound. For example, AEU=aE will turn HRAEUBG into \"lake\" and not \"laEk\"\nBecause of the enormous number of different spellings for the vowel sounds in\nEnglish, vowels are not included in the pronunciation variations. The combinatorial\nanalysis is done solely using patterns of consonant sounds to find eligible words, then\nthe eligible words are compared against the phonetics table for precise spelling\npossibilities.\nHere's an example item:\nTPH=n,in|kn,gn,nn,en\nThere are some important observations to be made about this item.\nFirst, there are only two different phonetic possibilities: The \"n\" sound, and the\n\"n\" sound preceded by a vowel (for example, \"in.\") On the right side, there are\nseveral different additional spelling variations for those phonetic possibilities. The \"kn\"\nand \"gn\" spellings are still pronounced the same way as \"n.\"\nSecond, there's an item \"nn\" which at first looks unnecessary. No word in English\nstarts with \"nn\" so why is it there? It's because Translation Magic and Global Magic\nare both capable of recognizing multi-stroke words, so it's entirely possible that the\nTPH could be in the middle of a word, not just at the beginning.\nFor example, you might write \"spinnaker\" as SPEU / TPHABG / ER.\nNow, there will be those reporters who would look at the above example and say\n\"I would never write anything that way.\" Some reporters would always use SPEUPB in\nthat situation because they always double the consonant sounds when it's a double\nletter.\nIf you are absolutely certain that you would never use one of the spelling\nvariations that appears in the default phonetics table, by all means edit the table to\nremove that item. Removing items that you wouldn't ever use is a good way to\neliminate false positives from the Magic functions.\n864 Eclipse Help\nBe especially careful when removing items from the vowel phonetics, however.\nLet's take the entry for EU:\nEU=i,y|ie,ei,ui,iE\nIf you use the EU only for the short \"i\" and not ever for the long \"i\" sound, you\nmight be tempted to remove the \"y\" and the \"iE\" from the list because you wouldn't\nuse EU for words like \"mylar\" or \"pine\". However, chances are you would use EU for\nwords like \"symbol\" and \"massive\". Likewise, the \"ui\" belongs, as well. You wouldn't\nuse \"EU\" for \"ruin\" but I'm sure you would use it for \"guilty.\"\nThe phonetics can be customized by either adding or removing entries.\nTo test your phonetics to see how well they're working with the magic features,\nthe best way to do that is to write a sequence of strokes and then make a global to\nsee if Global Magic can recognize the correct word. Keep in mind that Translation\nMagic may recognize the word but may not translate it depending on what the\nunderlying words are and what the adjacent strokes are, so you may have perfectly\ngood, working phonetics but not get the results you expect.\nIntelligent phonetics\nWhen you have selected Intelligent Phonetic type, and Phonetic untranslates,\nEclipse will check all the possibilities in the phonetics table to translate the stroke.\nEditing the Phonetics table\nThe phonetics table sorts by steno, making it unnecessary for you to put\nphonetics in the table in the proper order. Eclipse sorts entries in such a way that\nthey will apply properly no matter what. It sorts when you enter and leave the\nwindow, much as the metadictionary or the prefix/suffix table does. Note that if you\nwish to create right-side phonetics it is necessary to use the hyphen to dictate\nwhether the keys indicated are on the right side of the keyboard.\nThe table lists the steno stroke, followed by the possible pronunciations, the\npipe symbol (|), and the intelligent phonetics (all possible spellings, separated by\ncommas).\nReference Guide 865\nWhen you choose to Modify an entry in the Phonetics table, the Phonetics\ndialog opens for editing the steno phonetics for phonetic untranslates and the steno\nkeyboard simulator.\nHere are the controls:\nSteno: You can enter the steno keys that make up a particular phonetic element\nby pressing the Steno button.\nBasic spelling: Enter the phonetic text equivalent for the keys in question.\n866 Eclipse Help\nUse with keyboard: If the basic phonetic equivalent is a single letter, you have\nan opportunity to decide if that letter should be used as a keyboard equivalent for the\nsteno keyboard simulator. For example, for the phonetic TPH=n, you would want \"use\nwith keyboard\" checked. If you use the -Z key to add an \"s\" at the end of some\nstrokes, you might have -Z=s, but if you press the \"s\" key on the computer keyboard,\nyou probably don't want the Z to appear, so uncheck \"Use with keyboard.\"\nIntelligent spellings: Enter the various ways that phonetic element can be\nspelled, separated by commas as described in the dialog. Example: For TPH, you\nmight enter n,kn,gn\nAdd silent 'e': Pressing this button will add a silent \"e\" to the intelligent\nspellings if you're providing the spellings for long vowel sounds. Note that this is the\nsame as typing a capital \"E\" into the list itself.\nThe default phonetics table allows typing keys on the virtual steno machine\ndialog box to be customized from there.\nNote that there are duplicates that differentiate between the phonetic entry and\nthe keyboard entry. Most of them are the same, but there are a few others, for\nexample:\n-FPLT=fmt|fmt,fment\n-FPLT=.|.\n-RBGS=rks|rks,rction\n-RBGS=,|,\nSteno emulator shortcut letters\nWhen using the steno machine dialog, you can hit shortcut letters such as âdâ\nand the TK keys will be pressed down. Eclipse looks at the phonetic table under User\nsettings/Programming/Phonetics to determine what the equivalencies are.\nFor example, if you have TK=d|d in the phonetic table, the example given above\nwill still work.\nThis feature is available for non-English and non-stenographic keyboards, as well\nas being completely customizable.\nNote: If you get odd results, such as AOU for the 'u' key, it's because you have\nmore than one basic phonetic that results in a 'u'. For example, you may have the\nfollowing:\nAOU=u|iew,ew,yoo\nU=u|u,ou,uh\nIf that is the case, you may not be able to predict which one it will choose. You\nmust differentiate by putting a special marker on the one that you do NOT want it to\nuse:\nReference Guide 867\nAOU=u*|iew,ew,yoo\nU=u|u,ou,uh\nThe *, in this case, will mark it as a special exception that should NOT be\nregarded as the general rule for the letter 'u'.\nA set of default phonetics with these marks already in place is in the\nEclipsecat.set file.\n22.17.11.1Phonetics, Multi-Layered\nPhonetics, Multi-Layered\nThis feature exists so that pre-made theory phonetics tables can be created\nand distributed to users. It is possible to add additional layers to the\nphonetics table that pre-process untranslates before the basic phonetics are\nused.\nThe method for doing so is to place any number before the table entry,\nfollowed by a colon. You can have several layers by using several different\nnumbers. The numbers do not need to be consecutive. All of the numbered\nlayers will be processed in order, with the non-numbered layer being the final\none.\nHere's a short sample multi-layered phonetics table with just a few entries in\nit:\n10:TPH-=kn|kn\n10:OB=ob|ob\n10:OT=ot|ot\n20:TPH-=gn|gn\n20:OEPL=ome|ome\n20:AO=u|u\nTPH-=n|n\nPW=b|b\nAEU=ai|ai\nOB=ob|ob\n-L=l|l\n-S=s|s\n868 Eclipse Help\nThe numbers 10 and 20 were selected (rather than 1 and 2) so that if\nadditional layers are required that either go before the first one or between\nthe two, you can go back and add layer 5 or 15, still with room between,\nwithout having to renumber the existing layers.\nHere's how it works. In order for an untranslate to be converted into\nphonetics, ALL of the keys in the stroke must be accounted for in the\nphonetics table. Each layer will attempt to process the phonetic untranslate\nindependently, and if it is possible for the ENTIRE stroke to be processed\nusing ONLY the phonetics in the CURRENT LAYER, then the phonetics\nprocessor will use that particular phonetic.\nIf an untranslate cannot ENTIRELY be converted to phonetics using the\ncurrent layer only, it will drop down to the next layer and START OVER from\nthe beginning of the untranslate.\nSo, with the multi-layered phonetics table above, here are some results that\nyou would get:\nTPHOB --> knob (layer 10)\nTPHOT --> knot (layer 10)\nTPHOEPL --> gnome (layer 20)\nTPHAO --> gnu (layer 20)\nTPHAEUL --> nail (default layer)\nPWOB --> bob (default layer)\nYou will note that the same phonetic sequence (TPH-) can be interpreted\nseveral different ways depending on which layer is able to process the entire\nstroke.\nNote also, that some phonetics can and should appear in multiple layers even\nthough they aren't any different (OB)\nFor the purposes of illustration, here are some strokes that produce\nundesirable results using this small sample phonetics table:\nTPHOBS --> nobs (default layer. There's no -S in layer 10, so it can't use\nthat layer to process this stroke.)\nTPHOES --> TPHOES (there's no OE in ANY layer, so it can't process this\nstroke at all. Again, that's why the default layer must have, at the very least,\nevery individual key represented.)\nPWOT --> PWOT (Even though there's a PW in the default layer and an OT in\nlayer 10, this stroke cannot be processed because a stroke MUST be able to\nbe processed entirely using only the phonetics in a single layer.)\nThese simple examples are not intended to be used as-is. If you were to\nattempt to resolve all possible n\\kn\\gn phonetic representations using multilayered\nphonetics, you would probably find yourself making a phonetics table\nalmost as large as a dictionary, because you would essentially be making\nspecific words.\nReference Guide 869\nThis feature is most useful with steno theories that are designed from the\nground up to be dictionary-free or close to it, where the key combinations are\nintended to represent spellings rather than just sounds. Some of these\ntheories use key combinations that are context-dependent, where certain\ncombinations of keys represent one spelling when used with certain\ncombinations of other keys, and other spellings when used with other\ncombinations of other keys.\n22.17.12Prefix/Suffix Definitions\nPrefix/Suffix Definitions\nRELATES TO: Programming Tab , prefix/suffix dictionary\nentries , Insert Prefix/Suffix .\nThe Prefix and suffix definitions list, found on the User\nsettings/Programming tab, allows you to control spelling rules for prefixes and\nsuffixes.\nWhen you create a user, it will have a default set of prefix/suffix definitions; you\nneed only edit this list if you wish to alter the suggestions, or create new ones.\nNote: There is also a table called Suffix Spelling Rules ; this table is only\nused when the Prefix/Suffix Definitions list fails to produce a result. In other words,\nPrefix/Suffix Definitions is a higher priority; any desired customization should be done\nhere first.\nThis list is used any time you append a suffix or prefix to a root word. This can\nhappen when you write a root word followed by a suffix during translation , or\nwhen you use the Insert Prefix/Suffix command in editing.\nHere is the syntax for an entry in the Prefix/Suffix Definitions list:\nprefix or suffix=rule1,rule2,rule3,rule4...\nThe prefix or suffix is simply the general form: ^ing, ^ed, pre^, etc. The syntax\nis the same as in dictionary entries , except that no braces are used. Each rule is\nseparated by a comma.\nPrefix/Suffix Rules\n826\n960 370\n876\n243\n370\n960\n870 Eclipse Help\nEach prefix or suffix will have one or more rules that are used when attempting\nto resolve it. Eclipse will try the first rule; if this results in a correctly-spelled word,\nthat is the word you will get. If not, the program will move on to the second, third,\nfourth, etc., rule until a match is found. If a match is not found, the program will then\ntry to use the Suffix Spelling Rules list. If no match is found, the suffix will\nsimply be appended to the root word.\nEach prefix/suffix can have as many rules as it needs. Each rule contains certain\nsyntax that will modify the spelling of the root word:\nÂ· & will double the last letter of the root word.\nÂ· ^ will delete a letter from the root word. May be used multiple times to delete more\nthan one letter.\nÂ· Letters in brackets [] limit the ability of caret(s) to delete letters; only these\nletters may be deleted. For example, a rule of ^[e]ine will delete one letter, but only\nif that letters is E. Multiple letters may be used: a rule of ^[ey]ially will delete either\nan E or a Y, but will not delete any other letter.\nÂ· Letters in brackets and preceded with an equal sign [=] mean that letters will\nonly be deleted if they appear in this exact sequence. For example, a rule of\n^^[=ed] would delete the letters \"ed\", but nothing else, and would not delete any\ncombination of these letters such as \"de\". Note that rule this only makes sense if it\nalso includes two or more carets.\nÂ· Letters not in brackets are simply attached to the root word. For example, a rule\nof ^ing will delete a letter, and then add \"ing\" to the root word.\nUsing The Dialog To Make Changes\nTo create new entries in this list or edit existing ones, you may edit the text\ndirectly in the window, or you can click Add or Modify to open a dialog that will\nprompt you for the necessary information:\n876\nReference Guide 871\nSelect Prefix or Suffix to indicate which type of entry this is, and type the text\nof the suffix or prefix, such as ing or pre in the adjacent box. Do not include the caret\nor any special symbols.\nThe Possible Spelling Variations area manages all variations of a particular\nprefix or suffix. The list box will contain the list of each variation in the order they'll be\napplied, from top to bottom.\nThe Move Up and Move Down buttons will re-order the suffix rules. Select a\nrule, and then click one of these buttons to move it up or down.\nTo delete an existing rule, select it and then click Delete.\nTo add a new rule, click Add, and then use the remaining controls in the dialog\nto enter it.\nEnter the text that will actually be inserted, such as \"ing\" or \"ally\", into the\nInsert text box.\nIf Double final letter of root is checked, this suffix rule will double the last\nletter of the root word.\nSet Delete up to... Letters to the number of letters this suffix should delete\nfrom the root word. If this suffix does not delete letters from the root word, set this to\n0.\n872 Eclipse Help\nIf Delete up to... Letters is set to a number above zero, you can specify which\nletters should be deleted:\nÂ· of any kind: Letters of any kind can be deleted.\nÂ· if any of: Only specified letters will be deleted. Enter the letters you want it to be\nable to delete in the ...this text box. For example, if this suffix should only delete\nan S or D, enter \"sd\" into the text box. (The order doesn't matter.)\nÂ· if equal to: Only the exact string of letters specified in the ...this text box will be\ndeleted. For example, the ^s suffix should be able to delete \"fe\" from the end of a\nroot word and change it to \"ves\". Enter \"fe\" into the text box, and set Delete up\nto... Letters to 2.\nVisualizers:\nvF6_Prefixes_Suffixes.mp4\nvF6_Prefixes_Suffixes_Dialogue.mp4\n22.17.13Quoted Testimony\nQuoted testimony\nShift+Alt+Q (Quote)\nShift+Alt+N (Unquote)\nRELATES TO:\nFormat: Quote and Unquote ,\nProgramming tab ,\nUnder User settings/Programming there is an option entitled Quoted\ntext paragraph map.\nIt is used to define paragraphs that are changed to their quoted or\nunquoted equivalent using Format/Quote and Unquote or the speedkeys\nShift+Alt+Q (Quote) and Shift+Alt+N (Unquote).\nThe format for the entries is to put the unquoted paragraph name on the\nleft, =, and its quoted equivalent on the right.\nIf you want quoted paragraphs (particularly speaker names) to include a\nsymbol or other sequence of text before the name when it is quoted, add the\ntext as\n983\n826\nReference Guide 873\nSymbol=\"\nThe default map contains the following entries:\nÂ· Symbol=\"\nÂ· Answer=Answer (quoted)\nÂ· Question=Question (quoted)\nÂ· Speaker=Speaker (quoted)\nÂ· answer Paragraph=answer Pgh (quoted)\nÂ· question Paragraph=question Pgh (quoted)\nÂ· speaker Paragraph=speaker Pgh (quoted)\nYou can use this feature to design your own quoted paragraph mappings\nfor any paragraphs that might become part of a quoted portion of a\ntranscript.\n22.17.14Slop strokes\nSlop Strokes\nRELATES TO: Programming tab,\nUnder User settings/Programming there is an option entitled Stroke\nTransformations.\nThis is a different approach from the SLOPSTROKE = {=GOODSTROKE}\ndictionary entry which redirects a slop stroke to its proper translation.\nThe slop strokes feature in the programming tab allows you to define\nsingle stroke replacements such as:\nSTKPWR=STKPWHR\nIf the translator sees the original STKPWR stroke, it will change it\nimmediately to the appropriate replacement STKPWHR before even passing it\nto the translator.\nThe result is that the steno window in the document will show\nSTKPWHR, the proper stroke, not what you actually wrote.\nNote that this feature ONLY works with individual, single strokes. It will\nnot replace multiple strokes.\nThis is helpful if you have certain categories of slop strokes that might\nbe used in multi-stroke dictionary entries, because those entries will\ntranslate correctly. For example, if you have\nTRAPBLS=TRAPBS in the slop stroke table, and you have\n874 Eclipse Help\nTRAPBS/HRAEUT = translate in your dictionary, if you write\nTRAPBLS/HRAEUT, you will still get \"translate.\" The slop stroke dictionary\nfeature won't do that -- you have to use the Programming tab/slop stroke\nfeature.\nNote: there is still a role for the existing slop stroke dictionary entries.\nSometimes, a slop stroke is only recognizable in context with other strokes.\nFor example, you might define STPHAO STPH as {=STPHAO STPHAO}, but\nyou wouldn't put STPH=STPHAO in the slop strokes programming table.\nThe Slop strokes table can also work with partial matches. If you put in\na slop stroke of STKPWR=STKPWHR, it will only replace that exact stroke,\nthough it will work in dictionary entries containing multiple strokes. However,\nif you put in an entry of &STKPWR=STKPWHR, it will replace that key\nsequence anywhere it appears in any stroke, so even a single stroke\nSTKPWROBG would be replaced with STKPWHROBG.\nYou can use the Add or Modify buttons to easily modify the entries.\nThe steno dialog will appear, first with the âbeforeâ stroke, and when you hit\nOK, with the âafterâ stroke, making it easy to enter slop strokes into this\ntable accurately.\nUse this feature carefully. If you were to put in &RBS=RBGS to fix\nmisstroked commas, you would never again be able to write word like \"curbs\"\nor \"suburbs\" because ALL strokes containing RBS would be changed to RBGS.\n22.17.15Spelling Exceptions\nSpelling Exceptions\nRELATES TO: Programming tab ,\nCheck Spelling , Spell Check\nOptions .\nThe Spelling Exceptions list is where all acceptable double words and\npunctuation strings are stored. Any time you click the Add button during a\nspell check to accept one of these items, it is added to this list. You can\nalso edit this list manually. (Individual words that are added during spell\nchecking are stored in the User Spelling Dictionary.)\n826\n379\n383\n381\nReference Guide 875\nAcceptable double words appear in ALL CAPS in this list. For example, if\nthe word HAD appears in this list, the spell checker will not stop on \"had\nhad\". (NOTE: If the Double Words error category in Spell Options is\nunchecked, the spell check process will not stop any one double words, so\nyou will never get an opportunity to add to the Spelling Exceptions list. All\ndouble worlds will be ignored. If this item is checked, you will have an\nopportunity to correct them or not. If you want to use the Spelling\nExceptions list to control which double words are allowed, then you must\ncheck Double Words in the Spell Options dialog.)\nBe careful when editing punctuation strings that appear in this list.\nThese may contain trailing spaces, which may not be apparent. For example,\nthere might be an entry for dash that would have [space]--[space][space]\nand those spaces will appear in the editor as you move the cursor around,\nbut they won't be immediately apparent just looking at the list.\n22.17.16Steno Filter Regular Expressions\nSteno Filter Regular Expressions\nIf you have a regular expression you want to be able to use over and over\nagain, and/or if you want to design your own customizable search, you can\nedit this list.\nFor example, if you frequently do searches for speakers, you could make an\nitem that reads:\nSpeaker=\\{S:{}\\}\nAnd then to search for {S:MR.

It is used only when Prefix/Suffix\nDefinitions fails to produce the correct word. It also exists as a way to\ncustomize grammar rules for languages other than English.\nThe syntax for an entry in the Suffix Spelling Rules list is:\n892\n826\n869\nReference Guide 877\nRoot+SuffixBegins=NewSuffix\nRoot has two syntaxes: \"ends with\" and \"contains any.\"\nThe minus sign - indicates an ending. For example, -ic would mean a\nword that ends in \"ic\".\nThe brackets [] indicate that any of these letters may be used. For\nexample, [lmprs]ay would represent the wordparts lay, may, pay, ray, or say.\nThese may be used together. For example, -[aeiou] represents any word\nthat ends in a vowel.\nSuffixBegins is the beginning of any suffix this rule would apply to. For\nexample, ^ing would apply to ^ing, ^ings, ^ingly, or any other suffix that\nbegins in ^ing.\nNewSuffix is the suffix that will be used. Its syntax is similar to the\nPrefix/Suffix Definitions :\nÂ· ^ means delete a character. May be used repetitively, e.g. ^^^ will delete\nthree characters.\nÂ· & means double the final letter of the root word.\nÂ· % means to insert the original suffix at this point. For example, the\nfollowing two items are the same:\nOrder\nIf you are going to create new rules for this list, be sure to put the more\nspecific rules first. Eclipse goes through the list in order and stops when it\nreaches a rule that applies to the situation; if you create a specific rule, and\nit is preceded by a general rule that also applies, your custom specific rule\nwill never be used.\nUsing The Dialog To Make Changes\nTo create new entries in this list or edit existing ones, you may edit the\ntext directly in the window, or you can click Add or Modify to open a dialog\nthat will prompt you for the necessary information:\n869\n878 Eclipse Help\nSelect ends with or is equal to, based on whether you're specifying a\nword ending or a complete root word. Then, type the word or word ending in\nthe text box at right.\nThe and one of button will insert the set of characters that you type in\nthe box, so type first and then press the button. For example, if you want the\nnext part of the word ending to be any vowel, you could type \"aeiou\" and hit\nthe \"and one of\" button to add [aeiou] to the root.\nType the beginning of the suffix itself into the and the suffix starts\nwith: text box. Note that you cannot require an exact match, because\nvirtually all suffixes can be augmented (ing: ingly, ings, inged. ment:\nmented, ments, etc.) and they'll still follow the same rules when augmented.\nSet delete N letters from the root word to the number of letters you\nwant to delete. Note that unlike the prefix/suffix rules, which cross-check the\nspelling checker, this is not conditional or optional.If the prior conditions are\nmet, it will ALWAYS delete that number of letters and add suffix: This is\nwhere the suffix itself is added. MOST of the time, you will want to use the\nfollowing button:\nCopy original suffix: This simply types a % in the \"add suffix\" box. That\nrepresents a copy of the original suffix, so if the original was \"ing\" this will be\n\"ing\" and if the original was \"ingly\" this will be \"ingly\" so that there's never a\nmismatch. Note that you can add additional letters on either side of the %,\nsuch as e% to turn \"s\" into \"es\"\nThe and add suffix text box is where the suffix itself is entered. Most of\nthe time, you will want to use the copy original suffix button.\nReference Guide 879\n\"Under the hood\" - a detailed look at the suffix\nspelling rules.\nThe standard prefix/suffix rules are lists of spelling alternates that the\nsystem will advance through one at a time until the resulting word is found\nin the spelling checker.\nThose rules take the highest priority. However, if the system is unable\nto come up with a correctly spelled word, it then resorts to making a guess\nbased on some common sense rules of English spelling, such as deleting a\nsilent 'e' at the end of a root word before applying a suffix that starts with a\nvowel.\nThese guesses are based on rules which can be customizable.\nThe suffix spelling rules are rules that will be applied to word+suffix\ncombinations if no spelling variation specified in the prefix/suffix rules results\nin a correctly spelled word according to the current spelling dictionaries.\nThe rules will be applied from beginning to end until a match is found, so the\nentries will not sort when you add them; you may wish for certain rules to\nappear in a particular order.\nThe syntax for a suffix spelling rule is as follows:\nRoot+SuffixBegins=NewSuffix\nThe \"Root\" part supports the following special characters:\n- means ends with\nExample: -ic+ly=ally (if the word ends in \"ic\" and the suffix is \"ly\" the\nresult should be that the complete suffix should be spelled \"ally\". i.e.\nbasic{^ly}=basically)\n[] means set of characters to match\nExample: [lmprs]ay+ed=^id (if the word is \"lay\" or \"may\" or \"pay\" etc., and\nthe suffix is \"ed\" then apply a ^id suffix instead [delete last letter of previous\nword and add \"id\".] i.e. pay{^ed}=paid)\n\"SuffixBegins\" is an indication that the suffix does not have to be an exact\nmatch. It will look for a suffix that starts with the letters you provide. So, for\nexample, if you put \"ing\" the same rule will be applied for \"ings\" and\n\"ingly\" etc.\nThe \"NewSuffix\" part supports the following special characters:\n^ delete last letter(s) of root word\nExample: -py+ly=^ily (if the word ends in \"py\" and suffix is \"ly\" delete the\nlast letter and add \"ily\" instead. i.e. happy{^ly}=happily.)\n& double final letter of root word\n880 Eclipse Help\nExample: -mat+ing=&ing (if the word ends in \"mat\" and the suffix is \"ing\"\nrepeat the last letter of the root and add \"ing.\" i.e. format{^ing}\n=formatting.)\n% copy of original suffix\nExample: -e+i=^% (if the root word ends in \"e\" and the suffix starts with \"i\"\ndelete the last letter (e) of the root word and add the suffix as it was\noriginally spelled.)\nThis is going to be one of the most commonly used commands because the\nsuffix rules can be applied to any suffix that starts with the selected text. So,\nfor example, if you were going to make a specific \"ing\" rule, you would want\nto use % instead of \"ing\" on the right side so that it would apply correctly for\nthe \"ings\" and \"ingly\" suffixes, also. If you had -e+ing=^ing you would get\nsoothe{^ing}=soothing, but you would also get soothe{^ingly}=soothing.\nIf you made the rule -e+ing=^%, however, you would get the correct result of\nsoothe{^ingly}=soothingly.\nIf you look at the default rules, you'll see that most of them are like the last\nexample, where there are just a few letters designed to apply to as many\nsituations as possible. These are the most flexible rules, but if you decide to\nadd additional rules to supersede them, make sure that those rules go above\nthe more general rules.\nFor example, if you inserted a new \"ing\" rule in the following order:\n-e+i=^%\n-le+ing=^^ling\nit would never be used, because the previous item would apply to any\nsituation where the word ends in \"e\" and the suffix starts with \"i\" which is\nalready the situation if you have an \"le\" word and an \"ing\" suffix. You would\nhave to put it in the following order:\n-le+ing=^^ling\n-e+i=^%\nKeep in mind that the \"set\" syntax [] can be used multiple times in the root,\nbut is not available in the suffix. Because of that, it may be necessary to\nmake several copies of a rule to support several different suffix possibilities.\nFor example, the following five rules are necessary to double the final\nconsonant whenever the root word ends in consonant/vowel/consonant and\nthe suffix starts with a vowel:\n-[bcdfghjklmnprstvwz][aeiou][bcdfglmnprstz]+a=&%\n-[bcdfghjklmnprstvwz][aeiou][bcdfglmnprstz]+e=&%\n-[bcdfghjklmnprstvwz][aeiou][bcdfglmnprstz]+i=&%\n-[bcdfghjklmnprstvwz][aeiou][bcdfglmnprstz]+o=&%\nReference Guide 881\n-[bcdfghjklmnprstvwz][aeiou][bcdfglmnprstz]+u=&%\n22.17.18Text Filter Regular Expressions\nText Filter Regular Expressions\nIf you have a regular expression you want to be able to use over and over\nagain, and/or if you want to design your own customizable search, you can\nedit this list.\nFor example, if you frequently do searches for speakers, you could make an\nitem that reads:\nSpeaker=\\{S:{}\\}\nAnd then to search for {S:MR.

For example, if you write the word \"agree\"\nfollowed by a period (-FPLT) you could end up with \"agreement\" if Translation\nMagic guesses that -FPLT is a misstroke for -PLT. -RBGS can end up creating\nall sorts of interesting phonetic replacements with \"rks\" in them. For that\nreason, putting -FPLT and -RBGS on this list is recommended.\nYou may want to add some other high-frequency strokes, such as A or\nE, because they can often cause phonetic false positives.\nSecond, you can tell it never to replace a stroke that contains specific\nsteno, using the format &xxx.\nFor example, if you enter &RBGS, it will never replace a stroke that has\nRGBS in it at all. Use this carefully. After all, what if you tried to write\nSPHEURBGS and you wrote it SPWHEURBGS instead? The above rule would\nmean that Translation Magic wouldn't have permission to fix it.\nThird, you can eliminate certain entry text strings from consideration for\nmisstroke replacement. For example, you probably don't want an untran to\nbe interpreted as the {DELETE} stroke, or as an editing macro. You might\nalso want to prohibit print commands.\n892\n884 Eclipse Help\nYou can totally customize what you want to prohibit.

If you type âhelloâ the word âhelloâ will appear just as if you had\nwritten it on the steno machine.\nSo if there are functions you know how to do during translation but you\naren't sure how or if they can be accomplished from the computer keyboard,\nthis is a direct way to accomplish them from the computer keyboard.\nFor example, if you have an editor working behind the realtime reporter\nusing an output buffer, it is possible to make a macro that would allow the\neditor to send a {FLUSH} entry to force the buffer to be transmitted\nimmediately.\nNote that because the forced translation is a complete entry that\nappears immediately, if there is a stroke in the buffer waiting to translate,\nthe forced translation may appear before it.\n483\n958 483\n888 Eclipse Help\nYou can also type text and backspaces at the end of the document to\nredirect them to the output system. If you place your cursor at the very end\nof a document while in realtime, you can type text manually (and hit\nbackspaces manually) and that text will be sent directly to the output\nsystem. This can sometimes be a faster way to send direct content than the\nForce translation feature (though Force translation is more \"correct\" since it\nalso parses dictionary syntax as well as plain text.)\n22.18.2 Direct Output\nDirect Output\nShift+Alt+D\nor Tools/Realtime/Direct output..\nRELATES TO: Working With Realtime Output .\nSometimes it can be useful to send a command, made up of a string of data,\nDIRECTLY to the output system. Under Tools/Realtime, there is a function called\nDirect Output. If you select this command, it will display a window where you can\ntype a string of data. You can specify which outputs to send it to. For example, you\nmight have three outputs (captioning/ TeleView/ ANSI) and you only want to send it\nto the captioning output. You would just leave it at â1â. If you wanted to send it to\njust the ANSI and TeleView, you could put â2,3â or you could put âallâ if you wanted\nto output to all three.\n519\nReference Guide 889\nNote that the data input window allows you to hit control characters, so if you\nneed to send a sequence like Ctrl+C, Ctrl+A, 3, [enter] you could type Ctrl+C Ctrl+A\n3 Ctrl+M (the ANSI code for the [enter] key is Ctrl+M) and then hit [enter] to\ntransmit the string. Note that it would LOOK like this in the data window: ^C^A3^M\nand that you could, in lieu of pressing the control keys, simply type the ^ character\nand the capital letter. (If you want a ^ character, just type ^^.)\nYou can also put in hexadecimal codes directly, with the \\x syntax. For example,\n\\xC7\\xF3 would send the bytes C7 and F3 directly to the output.\nIn the example above, the ^C^A3^M, that happens to be the code to put a\ntypical closed captioning encoder into block mode. However, if you were to do this,\nthe Eclipse software would not now reflect that you were in block mode because this\ncommand completely circumvents the entire output system of the software. You could\nalso type âplease stand byâ and it would get transmitted to the output, but it would\nnot be shown on the preview window because, again, the output system is\ncircumvented by this command.\nThis command can be executed in a macro. You could also have steno strokes\nexecute such macros. This allows a user with sufficient technical knowledge (or with\nthe help of a device technician) to write whole new functions for particular output\ndevices even if the software does not overtly support those functions. For example, if\nan LED display manufacturer came out with an update to the display that allowed new\nfont sizes or colors that Eclipse didn't know about, if you could find the hexadecimal\ncodes or control keys to use to activate those features, you could use the Direct Data\nOutput to implement them without having to wait for an update to the Eclipse\nsoftware.\nThis feature is mostly for testing new realtime output devices, such as captioning\nencoders, LED screens, and CIC software. To use it, start a virtual realtime job,\nand use Output Formats to connect to the device. Then, just type the codes you\nwant to send to the device.\nWith this function, it is possible for Eclipse to output to devices that are not listed\nin Output Formats . If you know the exact code syntax that the device requires,\nyou can create macros that will open the Direct Output dialog and enter the codes\nthe device needs to turn on, off, change modes, etc.\nThe Send To Outputs controls which realtime outputs will receive this code. If\nyou have more than one output format , you can type 1 here to send to the first\nformat in the list, 2 to send only to the second, or \"1,2\" to send to both.\n22.19 RTF Conversions\nRTF Conversions\n272\n520\n520\n1018\n520\n890 Eclipse Help\nRTF files only support a subset of attributes that are common to most\nCAT systems. For example, RTF supports Question and Answer paragraphs,\nbecause all CAT systems support Q&A, but RTF does not support Comment\nlines, because those are unique to Eclipse. There are also elements unique to\nCase Catalyst files that do not get exported to RTF.\nCertain items, such as automatic indexing commands and form fields,\nare supported by many systems, but are done so differently that there is\nfundamentally no way to convert between systems, so form fields will always\nget converted to normal text.\nFor that reason, many reporters working with scopists on other CAT\nsystems will send over JUST the testimony, and after the scopist edits the\ncontent and sends it back, THEN the reporter will add the form pages and fill\nthem in. Unfortunately, that doesn't help with items such as marked block\nparentheticals, or any other form pages that appear in the body of the\ntranscript.\nNow, that said, if a user NEEDS to have the RTF convert between\nsystems with a minimum of fuss, it IS possible to do so if you're very\nintentional about it. Here are some guidelines:\n1. Avoid exotic paragraph types.\nIf possible, complex form pages should be created entirely using Fixed\nlines. All CAT systems have an equivalent of Fixed lines, so that will always\nconvert. Don't use several numbered style paragraphs in Eclipse. In the\ndocument, Q, A, Colloquy, Parentheticals and paragraphs will all convert fine.\nBy lines will change to Fixed lines, but will still look and print identically, so\nthat shouldn't cause a problem.\n2. Avoid mixing single and double-spacing.\nCAT systems have different rules about when a single-spaced line or\nparagraph should be single spaced with the paragraphs around it. In Eclipse,\nit will only single-space two lines that are BOTH set to single-spacing. In\nsome CAT systems, a single-spaced line can appear between two doublespaced\nlines. That discrepancy means that the same exact document might\nspace differently in two systems. To avoid a problem, single-space the\nENTIRE form page, and anywhere you need double-spacing, just add a blank,\nsingle-spaced, fixed line.\n3. Use page breaks\nThat kind of goes without saying, but I'll say it anyway. I still see users\nbreak a page by adding a bunch of blank lines to the end of a page. That's\njust not good in general, but it's even worse when using RTF. Note that RTF\nsupports page breaks, so they will convert just fine.\n4. Fill in your forms BEFORE converting.\nReference Guide 891\nForm fields attributes get stripped out when converting to RTF.\nHowever, if you fill in the fields in your form pages before converting, then\nwhen you convert to RTF, it will convert the fields to plain text. Since they're\nalready filled in, that's no problem. Everything will look fine and will print\nfine. However, if you convert a document that's full of fields that haven't\nbeen filled in yet, you'll end up with a giant mess on the other side.\n5. Either ignore formatting or make it match.\nEclipse applies your current document format when importing an RTF\nfile, so it doesn't matter what the document looks like on the scopist's\nsystem. If the scopist has 60-character margins and the reporter has 52-\ncharacter margins, when the reporter imports the RTF it will change\neverything to 52-character margins.\nIf the scopist is expected to produce the final version of the transcript,\nthey should change the settings on their system so that the margins are\nappropriate for the reporter's final document requirements.\nNote that not all CAT systems agree on what margin settings mean.\nSome systems will show inches instead of characters. Some will start on\ncharacter 0, some on character 1.\nIMPORTANT: Under NO circumstances should the same final document\nbe produced on two separate CAT systems. In other words, avoid having the\nreporter make the ASCII and the scopist make the printout; or the scopist\nand reporter each separately printing the document; or one making the\nprintout and the other the PDF. When a reporter and scopist are working\ntogether, the final version of the transcript needs to be established on ONE of\nthe systems ONLY. The reason for this is that CAT systems frequently\ndisagree on subtle formatting issues. For example, in Case Catalyst, the first\nspace of the two spaces after a period counts as a substantive character and\nwill cause the last word in the sentence to wrap to the next line if that space\nis over the margin. In Eclipse, that space does NOT count as a character and\nthe word will not wrap.\nTiny discrepancies like this can cause the page/line count to be\ndifferent on two different systems, even if the margins are identical. It is\nvirtually impossible to make two transcripts precisely match in formatting on\ntwo different pieces of software.\nHelpful indexing hint: RTF conversion wipes out indexing lines from all\nCAT software. No one handles it anything like the same way. There's no\npossible way to convert it. However, with Eclipse 5, there's a new method of\ndoing the automatic indexing that uses regular expression search patterns to\nfind the items in the document that need indexing. That means you can take\na finished document and generate an index without having to have index\nlines inserted throughout the transcript.\nThis method of indexing will work quite well with an edited file received\nin RTF format from a scopist on another CAT system.\n892 Eclipse Help\nThat about covers the issue. These are fundamental, unresolvable\nissues that have nothing to do with Eclipse or any other CAT system. There\nwill always be differences in software, and that will always mean that\ndocument conversions can never be perfect, so if users need to convert, they\nwill always need to use only those document elements that are a subset of\nboth systems. This is exactly the same principle that governs the use of\ndocuments in any software, as anyone can tell you who has ever attempted\nto convert documents from Microsoft Word to WordPerfect to OpenOffice, etc.\n22.20 Regular Expression Table\nRegular Expression Table\nCharacter Result/Use\nAny Represents any single character unless otherwise specified.\n.

Finds zero or one of the characters in front of the \"?\". \"Texts?\"\nfinds \"Text\" and \"Texts\" and \"x(ab|c)?y\" finds \"xy\", \"xaby\", or\n\"xcy\".\n\\ Search interprets the character that follows the \"\\\" as a literal\ncharacter and not as a regular expression. \"tree\\.\" finds \"tree.\",\nnot \"treed\" or \"trees.\" \"yes\\?\" finds \"yes?\", not \"yes\" or \"ye\".\nIf you need to search for a \\, use \\\\.\n\\w Represents any word character\n\\W Represents any non-word character\nReference Guide 893\n\\d Represents any digit\n\\D Represents any non-digit\n\\b Represents a word boundary. âfor\\bâ will find âforâ âfor thisâ and\nâfor?â but not âforgetâ.\n( ) Defines the characters inside the parentheses as a reference or a\ngroup. For example, \"a(bc)?d\" finds \"ad\" or \"abcd\".\n[abc123] Represents one of the characters that are between the brackets.\n[a-e] Represents any of the characters that are between a and e.\n[a-eh-x] Represents any of the characters that are between a-e and h-x.\n[^a-s] Represents any character that is not between a and s\n| Finds the terms that occur before or after the \"|\". For example,\n\"this|that\" finds either \"this\" or \"that.\" Note that you can have\na pattern that contains a partial either/or option by using the\nparentheses. For example, âMr.|Mrs. Smithâ would not search for\nâMr. Smithâ or âMrs. Smithâ. Instead, it would search for âMr.â or\nâMrs. Smithâ. The correct pattern would be â(Mr.|Mrs.) Smithâ\n{2} Defines the number of times that the character in front of the\nopening bracket occurs. \"tre{2}\" finds \"tree\".\n{1,2} Defines the number of times that the character in front of the\nopening bracket can occur. \"tre{1,2}\" finds both \"tree\" and\n\"treated\".\n{2,} Defines the minimum number of times that a character can\noccur. \"tre{2,}\" finds \"tree\", \"treee\", and \"treeeee\" but not\nâtreatedâ.\n{} Represent a piece of information for which you will be prompted\nseparately\n\\1, \\2, \\3 Represents a backreference to previously matched sequences in\nparentheses.

This window is fully re-sizable and will remember the size\nyou make it. Eclipse will also remember the location of the dialog in which\nthe strokes are being entered.\n173 320\nReference Guide 895\n896 Eclipse Help\nThe letters that are shown on the keys, and the style of the keyboard\nwill reflect the keyboard you selected in User settings/Input/Keyboard\nLayout.\nThis dialog is capable of displaying the Stenograph keyboard, the Treal,\nthe Gemini, the French Grandjean, the Italian Michela and the UK Palantype\nkeyboards. It also supports the custom steno formats for the Treal and the\nGemini which allow each individual key to be used independently with a\ncouple of exceptions (the âsâ keys are still tied together on the left, for\nexample.)\nExamples of some of the additional options:\nMichela and Palantype Steno Emulators\nThe keyboard, and the Steno Strokes dialog, are independent dialogs\nand can be repositioned relative to each other. (Typically, they appear in a\nvertical arrangement.)\nTo enter steno into the emulator, use the mouse pointer to click on the\nsteno keys to create the stroke outline. For example, for the steno STAEUT,\njust click the S, T, A, E, U, and T keys in that order.\nYou can also use the computer keyboard. When using the keyboard, you\ncan use the hyphen key to indicate keys on the right. For example, if the first\nkey you type on the computer keyboard is an âSâ, the S on the left of the\nwriter keyboard will be selected. If the first keys you type on the computer\nkeyboard are â-Sâ, the S on the right of the writer keyboard will be selected.\nReference Guide 897\nNote: If you type the letters out of order, it will behave like this: If you\ntype a letter, it will go on the left. If there are already keys on the left after\nthe point where that letter belongs, it will go on the right. If attempting to\napply the letter on the right doesn't result in a change on the keyboard, it\nwill attempt to apply the key on the left as if no other keys had been\npressed. If that still results in no change, it will apply it on the right as if no\nother keys had been pressed.\nKey combinations will be recognized. For example, pressing D on the\ncomputer keyboard will give you an initial TK. These combinations are taken\nfrom your phonetics table , where you can customize them.\nNumber keys, the asterisk, the pound key, and the exclamation point\n(mark) will also be recognized.\nPress the hyphen key to force a final-side key. Eclipse assumes that a\nkeypress is an initial-side key, unless there is only one possible key to the\nright of the last steno key entered. If your steno outline consists of only finalside\nkeys, such as -FPLT, press the hyphen key first. Nothing will appear to\nhappen, but any keys you press after that will be final side keys. (If you\ndon't preceed the F with a hyphen, you will get initial TP.)\nSearching for multistroke steno â type the first stroke as described\nabove, then click Next Stroke or the spacebar instead of OK.

Each stroke appears on a separate line in the\ndisplay area.\nCorrecting strokes in the emulator â If you enter a stroke in the\nemulator and then decide you donât want to search for it (or made a mistake\nin it), click on the stroke in the emulator window and then either click the\nDelete button or press the delete key on your keyboard. Using the delete\nkey, you can remove as many strokes as you like, one stroke at a time.\nBackspace clears the entire stroke, but does not delete it. To delete\n(remove) just the last letter in the stroke, hit Ctrl+Backspace.\nAdding strokes in the emulator â To add a stroke within the outline,\nselect the stroke beneath the line where you want to insert a stroke, and\nthen click the Insert button.

You can select a different Main translation dictionary, a\nJob dictionary (which takes precedence over jobname.dix dictionaries), and\nas many supplemental user dictionaries as you like (if you have dictionaries\nfor specific fields, such as medical or engineering terms). To indicate whether\na dictionary should be applied in translation, highlight the dictionary's name,\nand mark the Use in translation checkbox above the OK button, by either\nclicking on the box with your mouse, or using the tab/Shift+tab keys and the\nspacebar to select it. In the example, the Job dictionary is activated, and the\nmedical dictionary is not. (The Main dictionary is always active by default.)\nDictionaries not selected for translation are available for globaling entries\ninto, but will not be used in translation.\nTo change a dictionary, highlight the name of the dictionary you want\nto change and click Change. You will get a standard Open file dialog that\nyou can use to browse your folders and choose the file you want. By default,\nthe window shows the dictionary files in your job folder. Use the window to\nbrowse your folders; when you find the dictionary file you want to use, you\ncan either select it and then click OK, or double-click on it. Note that\ndictionaries are stored with the path name, so you do not need to keep them\nin your jobs folder. For example, you could make a folder called âDictâ in your\njobs folder and put your dictionaries there, and a dictionary will show up on\nthis list as Dict\\DixName. In situations where the system is unable to find a\ndictionary (for example, if you use an unusual path and you send a job and\ndictionary to a scopist who doesn't have the same setup) the software will\nlook in the same folder as the document, then it will look in the jobs folder.\nOnce you specify a dictionary, its name will appear in the field.

Here you can select folders for file storage, and set other\npreferences.\n101\n906 Eclipse Help\nFolders\nThe Directories area allows you to specify which folders on your computer are\nused for jobs, block files, and other special purposes. When you first use or create a\nuser for Eclipse, default folders are set for your Eclipse files.\nThe Advanced dialog has five fields for specifying file folders. These folders serve\nas default file locations for various operations. The New user setup wizard\nautomatically sets the âUsers,â âJobs,â and âBlocksâ locations. (The âNetworkâ and\nâAuxiliaryâ folders are not needed by all users and can be left blank.)\nTo specify where you want particular files stored, click the button corresponding\nto the type of folder you need to specify. Note that folders named âJobs,â etc. arenât\nautomatically created; these terms are used here just to designate the type of file to\nbe stored. You will get the Browse for folder dialog.\nReference Guide 907\nYou can navigate the folder list that appears just as you would if you were using\nthe Windows Explorer: the highlighted folder is the folder that is currently selected.\n(In the example above, HWilson is the selected folder.) Click OK to designate that\nfolder.\nIf you want to create a separate folder for jobs or other types of files, use the\nMake New Folder button to create the folders. Note that it is a matter of preference\nwhether or not to have separate folders for various file types.\nIf you need to set a different location for your folders, you can make the change\nhere in User settings/Advanced, or in User settings (Alt+U)/Programming\ntab/File Locations, which opens if you click the Other File locations button.\nTo change a folder assignment:\n1. Click the button for the assignment you wish to change (Users, Jobs, Blocks,\nAuxiliary, or Network).\n2. The Browse folder dialog will appear. Select the folder you wish to use, or click\nthe Make New Folder button.\n908 Eclipse Help\n3. Click OK.\nDirectories (Folders) and What is Stored There:\nThe Users folder -- where the Eclipse program is installed, and where user files\nare stored. Other directories (such as your Jobs folder) are typically nested inside this\nfolder. Do not change this folder assignment without expert guidance. The default\nlocation is C:\\Users\\YourName\\Documents\\Eclipse\nThe Jobs folder -- where your Eclipse files are stored. All dictionaries, text files,\nand note files will be created here, unless you specify a different location. For file\nmanagement purposes, you may want to create additional folders in your jobs folder.\nThis can be any folder you like. The default is C:\n\\Users\\YourName\\Documents\\Eclipse\\USERNAME.\nThe Blocks folder -- where your block files such as title pages and pick lists are\nstored. This can be the same as your Jobs folder, or it can be different. If you want a\ndifferent folder for block files, it is customary to create a Blocks folder inside your Jobs\nfolder. This is the only place where block file-related commands, such as Initial\nBlock/Final Block and the {<FILENAME} dictionary entry, will look for block files;\nyour block files must be stored here in order for these commands to work.\nThe Network folder -- a location that is used for networking functions. For\nexample, if you are using the Division Interval feature, the Network folder is\nwhere the shared files will be created. If your computer is linked to a network, certain\nfolders may already be configured for access by multiple users. You can also share\nfiles on your hard drive with others who can link to your computer. You should have\nâwriteâ privileges to the folder that you specify, meaning that you can create and save\nfiles in the folder. Others who want to access files in this folder will need âreadâ\nprivileges in order to open and view the files.\nThe Auxiliary folder -- a location that is used in file management. For example,\nif you want to copy old jobs to a separate folder, or to an external storage device, you\ncould select that location as the Auxiliary folder, and use the file manager to copy\nto/from that location. You can also Backup and Restore to/from the Auxiliary\nfolder. It is also a convenient alternate location for use as an alternative storage\nlocation for playing back multimedia files such as WAV and AVI files.\nYou can specify many optional file and folder locations in order to create whatever\norganizational structure you prefer for your files. The Other File locations button\nopens the File Locations , dialog where you can organize your folders and files to\nyour liking. This is the same folder that opens when you go to User\nsettings/Programming/File locations .\nUsing removable media as a file location\n275\n489\n677\n939 1048\n839\n839\nReference Guide 909\nYou can specify a thumb drive or removable hard drive or some other type of\nremovable media. It is theoretically possible to create a re-usable File Location for this\npurpose by specifying something like THUMB=F: under User\nsettings/Programming/File locations. The problem is that depending on what\norder you plug in one of these devices, or what USB port you plug them into, you\ncould end up with a different drive letter at different times. You might plug in your\nthumb drive one day and it's F:, and the next day it's H:\nTo use a removable media that Eclipse will be able to find consistently, specify a\ndrive name instead of a drive letter. This will look through the available drives and\nread the drive labels and will then automatically select the drive with that label.\nYou specify a drive label by using the following syntax:\n{LabelName:}optionalpathinfo\nSo, for example, if you had a USB Thumb drive with \"USB 16GB\" as the drive\nlabel, and it contained a subfolder called \"Archive\" which contained a \"2015\" folder,\nyou could create the following location:\nARCHIVE={USB 16GB:}Archive\\2015\nEclipse would find that drive no matter what drive letter it was assigned by\nWindows.\nNote that it's the colon (:) that differentiates this from a reference to another file\nlocation. BLOCK={JOB}Blocks is pointing to a subfolder of the JOB file location.\nBLOCK={JOB:}Blocks would point at a drive with the name \"JOB\" as the drive label.\nYou can change the drive label of any drive using Windows explorer. Right-click\non the existing name, choose Rename and type in any valid name.\nOther Options\nRevert Settings will cancel all changes made in User Settings since the last\nsave. If you change something by accident and want to cancel the change, click this\nbutton.\nRe-Enable Alerts will bring back all message that have been previously turned\noff via the \"Don't Show This Message Again\" option . The status of the various\nalert messages is stored in the editing settings, so if you export/import settings to\nanother user, the same warnings will be enabled or disabled as the original.\nAutomatically Load Last Settings Used, if checked, will automatically load the\nuser you were in the last time you ran the program. If not, you will have to select the\nuser each time you enter Eclipse. (You may manually switch users at any time via\nLoad Settings .)\n962\n102\n910 Eclipse Help\nThe Password text box will password-protect your user, which prevents anyone\nwithout the password from changing your settings. Type the desired password here.\nAfter you enter the password, click OK, and save the settings. The user is then\npassword protected. Whenever you attempt to load this user, you will be asked to\nenter the password. Note that this will not protect your files; it will only prevent\npeople from entering your user. To remove the password protection, reverse the\nprocess: delete the asterisks in the Password field. You will need to click OK and\nsave the settings for the change to take effect.\nThe Connection Magic button opens the Connection Magic settings\ndialog, used only when you have an internet connection, but want to use a local\nnetwork for Connecting.\nPort Log is a diagnostic tool. It should NEVER be turned on unless you are\ninstructed to do so specifically by an ASI support technician.\nVISUALIZERS:\nB1 - Load Settings\nB1a - Revert Settings\nC2 - Blocks Folder\n22.23.3 Exporting and Importing User Settings\nExporting and Importing User Settings\nUsing the User settings/User/Export settings.. button, you can\ncreate files that contain portions of your user settings. You can use these files\nto exchange selected settings among users without disrupting other settings.\nFor example, a firm could distribute its standard paragraph and document\nformat settings among its reporters, without changing the number\nconversion and translation settings that vary from one reporter to another.\nExporting selected user settings:\nSelect the Export button to open the User settings transfer dialog.\nThis window contains checkboxes for ten elements of User settings.\n913\nReference Guide 911\nMark the checkboxes of those elements you want to export.\nClick OK. A âSave asâ file dialog appears.\nType a name for this settings file and select Save. The exported settings are\nsaved as a Eclipse Portable settings file, which uses a â.setâ file extension.\nThe file can be provided to other Eclipse users, who can then import all or\nsome of the user settings contained in the file. The file can also serve as a\nbackup, from which the selected user settings can be restored.\nImporting User Settings:\nYou can import user settings from other Eclipse users. Hyperkeys that\nare assigned to macros are not converted; Hyperkeys that are assigned to\nstandard commands will be imported.\nThe following procedure overwrites the user settings that are currently\nloaded in Eclipse.\n1. Press Alt+U to open the User settings dialog.\n2. Press the Save settings button and enter a new name if you want to\ncreate a new user format to receive the settings.\n3. On the User tab, click the Import button.\n4. A file dialog appears. In the Files of type field, select Eclipse Portable\nsettings (*.set).\n5. Use the navigational controls in the file dialog window to open the\nfolder containing the settings file.\n6. Select the user file you want in the file display area and click Open.\n(You can also double-click the file name.)\n912 Eclipse Help\n7. The User settings transfer dialog opens.\n8. If you want the option to keep entries you already have for items in the\nProgramming tab (like the Metadictionary), you can turn on the Merge\nsettings where possible option, and it will merge the settings you're\nimporting, rather than simply replacing one with the other. If it detects that\na new entry would overwrite an old one, you will be prompted with a â...\nReplace this instance?â message. You can choose Yes to replace the old\nentry with the new one or No to keep the old one.\n9. When you click OK, the selected fileâs settings are imported into the\ncurrent Eclipse user file (*.ini file), replacing the current settings.\n22.23.4 Global Settings\nGlobal Settings\nIf you export some settings into a file in your JOBS folder called\nGLOBAL.SET, then those settings will be loaded every time you load any .ini\nfile that uses that jobs folder. This is useful if you have created a group of\nsettings that you wish to be applied to all of your various .ini files and you\ndon't want to have to go in and manually import them into each one.\nFor example, if you frequently edit macros or keystrokes, you may wish\nto create a global.set file that contains ONLY your keyboard settings. If you\ndid that, then you would be assured that no matter which .ini file you loaded,\nit would always use the keyboard set from the global.set file.\nReference Guide 913\nCaution: If you accidentally create a global.set file that contains\ndocument settings, for example, then any differences in the document\nsettings of your .ini files will be wiped out as soon as you load them up.\nThe global.set file can be deleted or moved or given to a friend just as\nany other file can.\n22.23.5 Connection Magic settings\nConnection Magic settings\nUnder User settings/User/Advanced there is a button for\nConnection Magic which opens up a dialog where you can change how you\nconnect, and set templates for your names for Shared Editing and Bridge\nsessions. You can also set up your cloud storage for Bridge Mobile jobs.\n914 Eclipse Help\nInternet URL and LAN settings\nThe internet URL will be automatically and should usually be set to\nhttps://connect.eclipsecat.com unless directed otherwise by technical\nsupport.\nIf you have Version 8 or above, anywhere you can browse the Internet,\nyou can use the Connection Magic infrastructure. You can use a keyless\nlicense, the Team Editing feature, and the Bridge Broadcaster over the\nInternet anywhere.\nIf you work in an environment that uses a url whitelist instead of a\nblacklist (this is extraordinarily rare) you can ask that connect.eclipsecat.com\nbe whitelisted.\nIf an IT manager in a courthouse is concerned about the possibility of\nsensitive transcript content being sent over the Internet and they wish to\nblock that possibility, but wish to allow Eclipse users to still be able to take\nadvantage of the keyless licensing, they should allow\nconnect.eclipsecat.com/license, but block connect.eclipsecat.com/content &\nconnect.eclipsecat.com/bridgelink.\nSession name templates\nIn the templates, you can use the same time/date codes used in the\nrealtime filename and elsewhere, such as %H and %M for hour and minute.\nIn the example above, for instance, %J will be a copy of the job name. A\ncomplete list of available codes is in the help page, Insert Time/Date .\nKeep your workflow procedures in mind when setting up a template. If\nyou are using the instant realtime button, you may already have the\ndate/time in the jobname, so you don't need a second time/date indicator in\nthe session name.\nYou can design your session names to help editors and clients tell your\njobs apart from other jobs available on the Internet.\n22.24 Visualizers - complete list\nVisualizers - complete list\nThe visualizers are divided into groups, each with its own help page.

Note that it will look very different depending\non whether you have a Passport, Gemini or Treal. The emulator will show you the way\nthe keyboard will currently behave.\n934 Eclipse Help\nAbove the keyboard graphic is a dialog that allows you to map any physical key\non the keyboard to a steno character. Press the Physical key button, which will show a\nsmaller steno machine, then select the key you wish to change. That will change the\ntext on the button. You can then select any of the available steno characters from the\nbuttons below.\nBy default, each key on the extended keyboards is a separate, distinct steno\ncharacter. The S key on a Passport, for example, is split into Z and S. The asterisk is\nsplit into * and ~. On a Gemini, there are TWO sets of central keys, meaning that the\nleft is divided into $ and % and the right into * and ~.\nSo, for example, if you wanted to keep the individual keys in all cases except that\nyou wanted to keep both the left-side keys as S, you could simply select the physical\nZ key and assign it to the S steno character. Note that when you do that, the\nkeyboard emulator below the dialog will now show S for both the upper and lower\nkeys on the left side.\nThis dialog has shortcuts for the most common keys that users might want to\nlink, such as the Z/S or the */~($/%). For Gemini and Treal keyboards, you may also\nwant to link the number bar keys together to simulate a single number bar rather\nthan having them behave as individual number keys.\nThere is a checkbox where you can select whether the number bar key changes\nthe rest of the keyboard or not. Usually, with the Gemini or Treal, you would select\nthis option only if you were linking the number keys together as a single number.\nReference Guide 935\nThis system gives you total control over how you take advantage of your\nextended keyboard. Perhaps you want to try the Passport with a split */~ key but\nkeep the S linked? No problem. You want to try the individual number keys on a\nGemini, but you want to link both the S/Z and the */~? Again, no problem. This\nsystem can support any possible arrangement and combination of extended keys. You\ncan even reassign the letter keys! As a really off-the-wall example, you might have\nthe extra row of keys on a Treal and want to shift all of your left-side letters over by\none key so that instead of ^ and + on the left, you start with Z/S (or S/S) and then\nput the ^ + in the middle. It's entirely up to you.\nNote: Once you have converted your existing standard dictionary over to\nextended format (which you can do by exporting it to RTF, changing to an extended\nkeyboard under the input options, then re-importing it to a new dictionary from RTF)\nthen you can try any combinations you like without affecting your dictionary.\nOnce you have converted your dictionary to extended format, it won't look any\ndifferent. But depending on how you've configured your extended keyboard, you\nmight have to hit entries differently. If you are using the split */~, any existing\ndictionary entry that contains an * has to be hit with the upper key. If you want to hit\nit with the lower key, you have to change the entry.\nYou can have different entries for the upper and lower, and these changes can be\nmade gradually. Likewise, if you wish to try the split S at some point in the future,\nyou can start out with it linked and then change it later without having to convert\nyour dictionary again.\nA few writers have characteristics requiring additional explanation:\nProCAT Stylus\nProCAT's Stylus writer creates note files in Stenograph format on their RAM card.\nYou can read those files without having to change your writer selection.\nThe Stylus also does audio recording and creates RTF notes and text files that\ncan be imported into Eclipse. The audio synchronization will work with the note\nreading or with the RTF import.\nThe ProCAT Stylus produces RTF text files based on the translator on the writer.\nThese files contain both absolute and relative timecodes. Eclipse imports these\nrelative timecodes.\nIf a user has a Stylus and wishes to read the notes and retranslate in Eclipse, one\noption is to take the RTF from the Stylus, even though it's a job RTF, and import that\nRTF into a note file. The result will be a note file that has correct absolute and relative\ntimecodes and will synchronize perfectly with the WAV file copied from the Stylus.\nProCAT Expression\nProCAT's Expression writer emulates a Diamante with its note file format, so\nusing the \"read notes\" function takes that into account and reads the notes in\nDiamante format.\nNone\n936 Eclipse Help\nThe writer choice of \"None\" gives you the ability to start a realtime translation\nsession with no writer attached at all. You can then start a realtime job in order to\nsend script lines to an output device, for example, for the hearing impaired for open\nor closed captioning. This will also work on an edit station.\nMichela MIDI and Michela MIDI 2\nThere are two MIDI Michela writers on the list. The second one uses the antistacking\nalgorithm, and the original one still waits for all keys to be lifted before\nregistering a stroke.\nDiamante/Mira/Fusion\nThe Mira-style USB realtime interface to the Diamante is functional, but it only\nworks in realtime. To read notes, it is necessary to plug the SD card into the computer\nor into an SD card reader. The new note file format is sufficiently different that the\nUSB interface will require some modifications in order to read the notes over the\ncable.\nDiamante/Mira/Fusion native note file format interface\nIt is not necessary to use the compatibility mode on the Mira or Fusion, nor is it\nnecessary to use the conversion utility for the Diamante notes. Eclipse can directly\nread the new date/time style filenames from the Diamante, Mira and Fusion. This\nincludes the time of day and relative timecodes.\nIMPORTANT: This means that when you have Mira/Fusion/etc. selected in Eclipse\nas your writer, Eclipse is not REQUIRING that the notes be in the newer date/time\nformat. If your Mira/Fusion is still set to have the note files in compatibility mode,\nthey will NOT work with Eclipse V5. The best solution is to set the writer to use the\nnewer file format. However, if you need to read files from the old format the solution\nis simple: Set Eclipse's writer setting to Stentura and it will read the older format files\njust fine.\nDiamante/Mira/Fusion audio sync adjusted to account for auto-pause\nThe timecodes read from the new note files and the jobname.apr files allow\nEclipse to synchronize with the WAV files recorded on the Diamante, Mira and Fusion,\neven if you have the auto-pause feature turned on.\nCase Catalyst / Diamante dictionary import function\nYou can use Tools/Import/Dictionaries/FromCase Catalyst to import the filename.sgdct files\ninto Eclipse. Note that it does not currently convert all of the special characters that can\nappear, but with enough additional information these could be added later. However, it will\nconvert all of the words, names, etc., that do not contain special commands such as new\nparagraphs, etc. Special commands will be converted as raw hexadecimal values such as /x16.\nIf necessary, find/replace functions can be used to substitute the appropriate Eclipse syntax. If\nsufficient examples are sent in to support@eclipsecat.comof what these special characters are\nand what they should look like, the converter can be modified to do those conversions\nautomatically.\nReference Guide 937\nPassport\n\"start from which stroke\" message in Passport\nYou will get the option of hitting first/last/other when starting realtime on a\nPassport (unless you use the instant realtime button.)\nPassport shadows appear on notes display\nAfter reading in a note file from the Passport, you can open the note file in\nEclipse and see the key shadows just as they appear on the Passport display.\nRemember that keys showing in any shade of red or pink are shadows and will not be\nused in the translation. Any keys showing in black or gray count as registered and will\nbe used in translation.\nVISUALIZERS:\nD1a - Extended Steno\nD1a - Extended Steno Dictionary\nD1a - Steno KeyMap\n938 Eclipse Help\n23 Appendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages\nThe Help pages in this section are listed alphabetically for easy\nreference.\n23.1 About Eclipse\nAbout Eclipse\nSupport/About Eclipse..\nUnder Support/About Eclipse, the dialog About Eclipse shows the\ncurrent version number and copyright information.\nThis dialog also shows your serial number, and authorization level.\nAdvantage Software Technical Support may ask you for this information.\nIf you have been running on a temporary passcode and wish to use the\nhardware key again, the Reset button will exit the program and invalidate the\npasscode. This allows you to switch you running on a key without having to\nwait for the passcode to expire.\nIf you are using a convenience key, you will find a K followed by a\nnumber in parens such as K(35). This means you have that many days\nbefore you must produce a spare key disk made from your main system.\nI you are using a keyless license, the About dialog gives you additional\ninformation: If you see a capital \"O\" that indicates that the license is only\nusable on-line. That is, you cannot use the license unless you have an\nInternet connection available. This should only happen if the system detects\nsome sort of license violation. If you are working offline, which is normally\npermitted, you will see a capital \"F\" indicating that the system is running\noffline and was not able to contact the license management server. In this\ncase, the dialog will also an indication such as (48 hours) telling you how\nmuch longer you can use the key while offline before you have to run Eclipse\nwhile you have access to the Internet in order to re-validate the license.\nAlso in this dialog you will see numbers describing the current version\nof Windows. It will be something like this:\nOS: 6.2.9200.2\nThis represent the Version.Subversion.BuildNumber Platform Details\nFor example, Windows 10 & 11 are 6.2 and above.\nIf you use Boost, Boost Flow or Eclipse RSR you can check your speech\nminutes balance here.\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 939\n23.2 Backup\nBackup\nTools/Backup..\nRELATES TO: Restore .\nBacks up a file or group of files to a specified location.

In the Windows taskbar, it will show up as a separate program to\nmake it easier to select.\nAll edits done within the range of the CART window will show up for the\nviewers. Note: This is different from the Bridge refresh because the CART\nwindow is entirely internal to Eclipse, so it's simply a mirror of the editing\ntext.\nIf you have selected \"apply edits\" in the Output format, the CART\nwindow will refresh automatically. However if you are using a feature like\nGoogle translate that relies on the text remaining unmodified, turn off \"apply\nedits\" and you will show the translated text instead of the contents of the\ndocument.\nThe CART window can be moved by clicking and dragging it. It can be\nresized by clicking and dragging near the lower-right corner.\nRight-clicking on the CART window will bring up the CART setting\ndialog.\n944 Eclipse Help\nFrom this dialog, you can:\nÂ· Maximize the window by checking the box.\nÂ· turn the Smooth scroll off if it's too performance-intensive for your\nhardware\nÂ· use the Always top window option to select whether you wish for the\nCART window to be always the top window or not. It is helpful to be able to\nmake it always the top window if you're displaying the CART window above\nanother application, such as a power-point presentation, when that\napplication has to be the active application during the realtime session.\nÂ· use the Anchor option to set a persistent location for the CART window\nÂ· use the Font button to select whatever font you want on the CART window.\nClick the Eclipse icon in the upper left corner to Move, Close, or\ncustomize the Cart settings dialog.\nThe foreground and background colors can be selected by going to User\nsettings/Display/Color selections and selecting \"CART window\" colors\nfrom the drop-down list. The default colors are white on black. The CART\nwindow will show paragraph label colors that match the label display colors in\nthe editing document. It will also show Speakers' names in the colors you\nassign on the Speaker List, if you have Apply edits on.\nThe CART window also supports color changes selected for Speaker,\nQuestion and Answer labels. Go to User settings/Display/Color\nselections to modify the foreground or background colors of these labels.\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 945\nThe CART window is independent from the Eclipse window and can be\nmoved to a separate screen, such as a projector or an external monitor. Note\nthat if you anchor a CART window that is on an external monitor, this could\nresult in the window accidentally being placed where you cannot see if you\nlater attempt to use it on your system when you do not have the external\nmonitor attached.\nThe text in the CART window will automatically word-wrap to the exact\nsize of the CART window itself, based on the size of the text as defined by\nthe font size.\nThe paragraph symbol used to indicate a musical note on the closed\ncaptioning display will also appear as a musical note on the CART Window.\nIf you have a laptop with an external monitor port, you're probably\naccustomed to displaying your Eclipse screen on projector or large monitor to\ndo CART. In addition most laptops support dual-screen, which means that\nyour Windows desktop can stretch across two screens.\nIf you set up your external port as a dual-screen instead of a clone, then\nyou can drag the CART window over to the external screen. That means that\nyou will be able to use all of Eclipse on your laptop screen, including the\nsteno, the auto-brief window, the toolbars, using macros to make globals\nfrom the machine, etc., and the CART audience will never see it.

This allows you to include glue templates with dictionary entries, in\nanticipation that you will need them soon. For example, you could redefine\nyour entry for \"spell\" as \"spell{&-*}\" to force your next series of glue\ncharacters to be stitched.\nGlue entries stick to each other and not anything else. The glue\ncharacters will not attach to the word following or preceding. So you don't\nneed different entries for characters that begin or end a string.\nYou do not need glue entries for numbers. If you check Glue Numbers\non the Numbers tab of User Settings, numbers will automatically behave as\nglue characters when written in conjunction with glue characters. This allows\nyou to write alphanumeric combinations like license plate numbers. If you\nprefer, you can turn this off, but if you have number conversion off, you\nprobably won't want to do this, because you will get, for example, F 3 5 0. If\nyou have number conversion on, you will get F 350.\nAdditional help with using Glue characters is in the Reference Guide.\nFont Commands\nWill change the font.

It is simlar to keymode, but\ninstead of fingerspelling, anything you write will be translated against your\ndictionary. This mode is used in macros designed to correct misstrokes; it allows\nyou to write the stroke correctly into the global dialog . For more examples of\nhow this mode works, see the Eclipse Realtime Kit.pdf file in the Eclipse\ndocumentation folder.\nÂ· Off will turn off all specialty modes, and return you to normal relatime translation.\nAny realtime editing macro that switches to another mode to perform its task, will\nswitch back to this mode to return things to normal before the macro ends.\nOther Items\nUncheck COM Port to suspend access to the COM port. If you are going to\nunplug your writer from your computer to a do a bench conference, some steno\nmachines prefer to have the port turned off before you plug them back in.\nSuspend Key will temporarily suspend the execution of the software. This allows\nyou to take the key off, and move it to another Eclipse computer without exiting the\nprogram. This is useful when transferring files. The key will remain suspended until\nyou close the Edit Toggles dialog.\nVISUALIZERS:\nA7 - Hyperkeys\nE1 - Insert/Overtype\nE2 - Scan/Multi-scan\n230 226\n230 226\n494\n331\n31\n494\n331\n31\n966 Eclipse Help\n23.15 Exit\nExit\nAlt+X or File/Exit\nCloses the program.

You can also accomplish this via Convert on the Tools menu.\nHere are the general instructions for exporting a file:\n1. Open the file you wish to export.\n2. Select Export from the File menu.\n3. In the Files of Type drop-down list at the bottom of the file dialog , select the\ntype of file you wish to export to. (Your choices here will vary by file type: see the\nsections below for a detailed explanation of each.)\n4. Type the name you wish to give the file in the File Name text box. The exported\nfile will default to having the same name as the Eclipse file.\n5. If you want to store the file in a different folder, use the file dialog to navigate to\nthat folder.\n6. Click Save.\n7. The progress bar will appear, indicating progress of the export.\nExporting A Dictionary\nWhen exporting a dictionary, you do not need to select a file type in Step 3. You\nwill be prompted to do so before the file dialog opens:\n945 693\n694 224 672\n948\n1036\n969\n1040\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 967\nSelect the type of file you wish to export to. Then, the file dialog will open; you\nmay then resume the above steps at Step 4.\nHere are the types of files you can export a dictionary to:\nÂ· ASCII. Creates an ASCII (raw text) file of your dictionary. Can be used for\nexporting to other CAT systems, but RTF is preferable.\nÂ· RTF/CRE. Creates an RTF file of your dictionary, which can then be imported into\nanother CAT system.\nÂ· Split key format. This is an automated dictionary export that attempts to adapt a\nnon-split dictionary to a split-key dictionary. After exporting a main dictionary to a\nnew split key main dictionary, don't forget to change your main dictionary to use\nthe new converted split key dictionary.\nÂ· Stentura Dictionary. Creates a dictionary disk for the Stentura 8000 writer. After\nthe status bar closes, you will be prompted to insert a disk. If the dictionary\nrequires two or more disks, you will be asked for them in succession. You will not be\nasked to entire a filename: this is handled automatically. To install the dictionary\ninto the writer, put the disk in the writer's disk drive and turn it on. The existing\nmain dictionary will be overwritten with the new one.\nÂ· Word List. Will create a list of all the entries in your dictionary. Does not include\nthe steno. The file will be in .TXT form.\nÂ· ASCII (text first). Creates an ASCII file of the dictionary, sorted in alphabetical\norder by definition. (The ASCII choice is sorted in order of steno keys.)\nÂ· Passport. Creates a Passport format .pdx of the dictionary. This file can be copied\nonto the memory of the Passport or loaded into the Dictionary screen of the Passport\nTouch.\nÂ· RTF For Steno Machines. Creates an RTF creates specifically to load onto non\nAdvantage steno machines.\n968 Eclipse Help\nThe Start At... button allows you to export only part of the dictionary, by\nselecting a steno stroke at which the export will begin from the Steno Emulator .\nAll strokes \"after\" that stroke in steno order will be exported: all strokes \"before\" that\npoint, in steno order, will not. To see what steno order looks like, sort the\ndictionary by steno.\nExporting A Text File\nThere are no special options for exporting text files. You may export to any of the\nfollowing formats:\nÂ· RTF. Primarily used in conversions to/from other CAT systems.\nÂ· Raw Text (ASCII) (*txt.). Raw text.\nÂ· Bridge. This will create a file that can be opened and viewed in Bridge, Advantage\nSoftware's own CIC program.\nÂ· HTML, This will create an HTML file, which can be viewed in a web browser.\nÂ· SCC captioning, SMPTE-TT, SAMI, and WebVTT are all captioning formats.\nSCC captioning - Files in this format can be imported by a number of off-line\ncaptioning software products such as the CPC software. Some encoding hardware can\ndirectly import .scc files and encode the captions stored in them directly to video\nwithout using any additional software. SCC files contain timecodes and captions, so\nyou can do a live captioning job, go back and clean up the text, and then provide a\n.scc file to the station so that they can burn the edited captions on the stored copy of\nthe program for later distribution.\n893\n141\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 969\nSMPTE-TT is a specialized type of XML output that is used for web-based offline\ncaptioning. Like the .scc output, this is being used by many companies in order to\ncomply with the regulations for providing off-line versions of on-line captions when\nvideos are published on the web.\nSRT file format is used for post-production media file subtitles. This means that\nyou can match up a document.srt with a document.mp4 file, for example, and when\nyou play the video, the subtitles will be displayed automatically and synchronized\naccording to timecodes.\nSAMI files are used for post-production captioning on Windows Media player\nfiles.\nWebVTT files are for non broadcast captioning.\nExporting A Steno File\nRaw steno files can be exported to .RTF or .TXT. As with other file types, RTF is\nprimarily useful as a means of conveyance to/from other CAT systems.\nIf you are exporting raw steno to a .TXT (ASCII) file, after you select a filename,\nthe Notes To ASCII dialog will appear:\nThe Absolute Timecodes and/or Relative Timecodes will include timecodes in\nthe file. You may have one set of timecodes, both, or neither. Checking Translation\n(Phonetics) will include a phonetic translation next to each steno outline.\n23.17 File Dialog\nFILE DIALOG\n970 Eclipse Help\nThe file dialog appears any time you have to select, save, or create a file.\nYou can open a file by:\nÂ· Double-clicking its name\nÂ· Single-clicking its name and then clicking OK.\nÂ· Typing its name into the Name text box and clicking OK.\nDetails on using the Eclipse File dialog are in the Quick Start section under File\nDialogs.\nThe Browse button allows you to use the Windows \"Open\" file dialog to access to\nother folders, drives, and locations where files might be stored.\nWhen in the Windows Open file dialog, you can use these features:\nShortcuts to file locations located on the left.\nThere is a drop-down list that allows you to make only certain file types visible.\nMost of the time, Eclipse will select this for you, based on your actions within the\nprogram. (For example, if you press Alt+E to open a text file, File Type will\nautomatically be set to Text Files.)\nClicking the Cancel button, or pressing the Escape key on the keyboard, will exit\nthe file dialog without taking any action.\nThe appearance of the file dialog may vary, depending upon your version of\nWindows, and your Windows customization settings.\n59\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 971\n23.18 File Extensions\nFILE EXTENSIONS\nAn extension is a three-letter code that is traditionally appended to each\nfile name on your computer. The extension tells you what type of file it is.\nHere is a list of all file extensions you might encounter in Eclipse, and\ntheir meanings:\nÂ· BAK - A backup file, created by the Timed Auto Backup feature in\nEclipse.\nÂ· BRG - A CIC file that can be viewed in Bridge, Advantage Software's own\nCIC program.\nÂ· CIC - A CIC file. Can be renamed to TXT\nÂ· DIX - Eclipse dictionary .\nÂ· ECL - Eclipse text file .\nÂ· ENG - A text file from Eclipse Version 8 (DOS). An .ENG file can be\nconverted to a Eclipse .ECL files via Import or Convert .\nÂ· HSD or HSE - Spelling dictionary files, for use in spellchecking . Do not\ndelete these in the file manager unless you are sure what you're doing.\nÂ· INI - Eclipse user settings file.\nÂ· MAC - A file containing exported macros .\nÂ· NAM - An Eclipse Version 8 file. See the page on importing from Version\n8 for an explanation.\nÂ· NOT - Eclipse note file .\nÂ· PDF - Portable Document Format . This is the type of file you create if\nsomeone asks you to email them a printable version of a transcript, or a\nconcordance .\nÂ· PHB - A phone book , for use in captioning .\nÂ· PY - Python macro files, don't delete these unless you're sure!\nÂ· RTF - Rich Text Format, a generic format for text files. Most likely, this file\nwas created in the process of converting a dictionary or text file from\nanother CAT system. Conversion can be done via Import , Export , or\nConvert .\nÂ· SCL - A script list file.\nÂ· SDF or SDIF - Standard Dictionary Interchange Format. This is a\nconversion format used by some older CAT systems.\nÂ· SET - Eclipse settings transfer file .\nÂ· TRK - An Eclipse Version 8 file. See the page on importing from Version\n8 for an explanation.\nÂ· TXT - ASCII file.\nÂ· WAV - Audio file. This file is created whenever you use the Record\nAudio feature in realtime, or if you are a voicewriter recording a\nroom track .\nÂ· ZIP - A zipped file.\n308\n672\n694\n694\n990 948\n379\n677\n99\n1016\n993\n224\n1037\n616\n1038 666\n990 966\n948\n1052\n102\n993\n622\n649 1164\n1167\n639\n972 Eclipse Help\n23.19 Filter Expressions\nFilter Expressions\nRELATES TO: Programming tab,\nDictionary filter , Custom Search\nBuilder .\nThe Steno Filter Regular Expressions and Text Filter Regular\nExpressions items on the Programming tab allow you to create custom\ntext and steno filters, for use in the dictionary filter .\nNOTE: regular expressions can be arcane.

These are on the Text Filter Regular\nExpressions list:\nThe only expression in the Contains filter is the user prompt. You type\nwhat you are searching for, and the filter will turn up any entry that contains\nwhat you typed.\nStarts With includes the ^ code at the beginning. Whatever you type\nwill have to appear at the beginning of the entry. Ends With and Exact\nMatch work on the same principle: there is a user prompt {} combined with\na ^ (must start with) and/or a $ (must end with) code.\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 975\nText To Match\nYou may include specific text in the search filter.

Here are some more examples from\nthe default filters:\n976 Eclipse Help\nThe Capitalized filter was explained in the table: it consists of a starts\nwith command ^ followed by a range of all capital letters. If you only wanted\nto search for entries that started with A through D, for example, the syntax\nwould be ^[ABCD]\nThe Conflicts filter combines a must start with command and a text\ncommand. The ^\\ at the beginning means \"must start with a backslash\"; the\nsecond slash means \"must contain a backslash.\" The total entry is ^\\\\\nYou can't see it, but in the Phrases filter, the equals sign is followed by\na space. This will search for any entry that contains a space.\nThe Macros filter searches for any entry that begins with {M: which is\nthe dictionary syntax for a macro.\nBoth the Number Triggers and Speakers filters search for the syntax\nthat uniquely defines that type of entry. Both of these entries will match\nentries that contain {# or {S: at any point in the entry.\nFor example, if you want to make an entry that will search for trigger\nstrokes only if they are standalone entries, you could do: ^{#.}$ That's a\nmust start with command; {# to search for that text; a period to represent\nany one character; and a dollar sign to indicate that the entry must end at\nthat point. As you can see, while regular expressions can quickly become\nvery arcane, they can be understood if you know what each symbol means.\nAdvanced Text Commands\nHere are some more ways to control the text in a search:\nExpressio\nn\nMeaning Example Matches Non-Matches\n958\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 977\n. any\ncharacter d.g dig, dug Doug\n\\d any number \\d- 5-day, 10-mile x-ray\n\\D\nanything\nthat is not a\nnumber\n{#\\D}\n{#G}\n{#N}\nExhibit{#G}\n{#3}\n\\w any number\nor letter \\w any number or letter\nanything that is not a\nnumber or letter (like\n#)\n\\W\nanything\nthat is not a\nnumber or\nletter\n\\W\nanything that is not a\nnumber or letter (like\n#)\nany number or letter\n[^abc]\nMust not\ncontain a,\nb, or c.\nAny of the\nabove text\nidentifiers\nmay be\nused here:\n[A-Z] for\nany capital\nletter; \\d\nfor any\ndigit, etc.\n[^a-z]\nany entry that is ALL\nCAPS, or otherwise\ndoes not contain any\nlower case letters\nany entry with one or\nmore lower case\nletters\n\\\nLiteral\nsearch.

Use one or the\nother.\nDictionaries\nUsing the Go To command in a dictionary file opens the steno\nemulator , where you can specify a steno outline to jump to.\nNote Files\nUsing the Go To command in a note file opens a dialog where you can\nspecify a stroke number or fold number to jump to. Entire the desired\nnumber into the Stroke Number or Fold Number text box. You can also\nspecify how many steno strokes make up one fold, by entering a number into\nthe Fold Size text box. The default is 46, which is based on the dimensions\nof steno paper.\n23.28 Help Topics\nHelp Topics\nF1\nOpens the Eclipse help system. The Help System offers many different\nways to find the information you are looking for:\nÂ· \"Working With\" pages. These new pages are overviews of general\ntopics: realtime, dictionaries, indexing, users, etc. If you want to learn\n893\n990 Eclipse Help\nabout a general topic, these pages are a good place to start. There is a\ncomplete list of them in the Table of Contents.\nÂ· Context-Sensitive Help. Whenever you press F1 from within Eclipse,\nyou will be taken to a help page that is relevant to your location in the\nprogram. You may also quickly view a page about a specific menu item\nby selecting that item in the menu, and then pressing F1.\nÂ· Search. Click the Search tab to perform a text search of the entire help\nsystem. Enter the term you are interested in, and a list of pages\nmatching that term will appear.\nÂ· Visualizers. Many help pages have a Visualize! icon, which will play a\nbrief how-to video demonstration of the topic. You may also view a\ncomplete list of Visualizer demonstrations by selecting Visualizer Topics\nfrom the Support menu.\nÂ· Table of Contents. In the left pane, clicking the Contents tab will take\nyou to the Table of Contents for the entire help system. Topics are\norganized categorically. There is also a list of all pages.\nÂ· Index. Clicking the Index tab will take you to an index of topics. Each\nitem in the index links to a specific page. Some index items have subheadings.\nDetails on working with the Help systems are on the Welcome to Eclipse\nHelp page.\n23.29 Import\nImport\nFile/Import..\nImport is one of two ways to convert external files into Eclipse files. (You may\nalso do conversions via Convert on the Tools menu.)\nDo not use Import to merge two different Eclipse files of the same type, such as\nmerging two Eclipse dictionaries or two Eclipse text files. Use block read (Alt+R) ,\nblock write (Alt+W) , or other block operations do this this.\nTo import a file:\n1. Open the dictionary or text file you wish to import into. If you wish the\nimported file to be a new file, create a blank file of that type first, and\nimport into that.\n2. Select Import from the File menu.\n16\n948\n392\n393 392\n672 694\n84\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 991\n3. In the drop-down list at the bottom of the file dialog , select the type of file\nyou are importing. For text files, this can be an RTF, TXT (ascii), or ENG\n(Eclipse Version 8) file. For dictionaries, this can be an RTF, TXT (ascii),\nDIX (Eclipse Version 8), or SDF . For text files it can be Rich text format\n(rtf), Text/ASCII (txt), or Eclipse v8 (eng).\n4. Using the file dialog, navigate to and select the file you wish to import.\n5. A progress bar will appear, indicating the progress of the import.\nIn addition to the above, here are some tips on importing files:\nImporting Text Files from RTF\nThe most effective way to import a transcript from another CAT system is to\ncreate an\nASCII should only be used as a last resort. t RTF file on that CAT system, and\nthen import the RTF file into Eclipse as described above. RTF is a general format that\nmost CAT systems can import from and export to.\nIf the other CAT system cannot provide an RTF file for whatever reason, and only\na native file for that system is available, you may still be able to import it into Eclipse\nvia Convert , on the Tools menu.\n969\n971\n971\n1040\n948\n992 Eclipse Help\nWhen you import an RTF file into Eclipse, the margins will reflect your selections\non the Paragraphs Tab and Document Tab of User Settings (as opposed to\nwhatever the margins were on the CAT system it was exported from). For best results,\nset your margins to match what they were on the other CAT system. You can do this\nin the Current Document only , or you can create a new user for this\npurpose.\nWhen you import via RTF, the steno tracking will import as well, allowing you to\nperform globals .\nImporting Text Files from TXT (ASCII)\nYou should only import text files from ASCII as a last resort. You will get no\nsteno tracking, and the file is more likely to require cleanup than a file imported via\nRTF, or even from the native format of another CAT system.\nWhen you import a text file from ASCII, you will see the ASCII Import dialog:\nYou will make choices here based on where the file came from, and how you want\nto use it after you import it into Eclipse.\nÂ· Import only the numbered lines, starting with line ___: Only lines that have\nline numbers will be imported. Other lines will be omitted from the .ECL file.\nSelect this option if your file contains headers and footers, or any other unnumbered\nline you'd prefer to omit. If the incoming ASCII file has numbered\nheader lines, then you want to ignore those and start with line 2, for example. Do\nnot select this option if your file is single-spaced at any point, since \"half-lines\"\nare typically un-numbered.\nÂ· Import The Data Into Fixed Paragraphs: If checked, each line of the ASCII\nfile you are importing will appear in a separated Fixed line. If unchecked, Eclipse\nwill try to convert each line of the file into appropriate paragraph styles\n(Question, Answer, Colloquy, etc.) If you just need to print the file, leaving this\nitem unchecked will produce better results. If you need to edit the file after\nimporting it, you should check this item.\nÂ· Spaces To Trim From Left: If set to a number above zero, that number of\nspaces will be trimmed from the beginning of each line. Most times, you can\nleave this at zero. If you import an ASCII file and find extra space at the\n447 434\n432 108\n326\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 993\nbeginning of each line, re-import the ASCII file, and set this to the number of\nspaces it was.\nImporting Text Files From Eclipse Version 8\nIn Eclipse Version 8, text files had an .ENG extension. You can import them into\nEclipse, as described in the steps above. However, transcripts in Eclipse Version 8\nwere comprised of three files; .ENG, .NAM, and .TRK. When importing an .ENG file,\nyou will want to place the .NAM and .TRK files in the same folder.\nIn Step 3 above, you will select .ENG as Files of Type. In Step 4, you will select\nthe name of the .ENG file itself. You do not select the .NAM or .TRK files; they need\nonly be in the folder at the time.\nBe aware that not all .ENG files have .NAM and .TRK files associated with\nthem. .NAM is a list of speaker names, and .TRK is steno tracking. If this file doesn't\nhave speaker names and/or steno tracking (if it's a block file, for example) these files\nwill not exist. Just import the .ENG file.\nImporting Dictionaries\nDictionaries can be imported from RTF, TXT (ASCII), Eclipse Version 8, or\nSDF/SDIF (an exchange format used by some older CAT systems).\nIf you are importing into a dictionary that already has entries in it, any entries\nwith the same steno will be overwritten, even if you have Detect Conflicts\nchecked. If you're concerned about entries being overwritten, import into a blank\ndictionary, then block read the two dictionaries together. Detect Conflicts will\ntake effect.\nIf you use File/Import or Block/Read from within a dictionary you can select\nmultiple files to import.\nWhen you import a dictionary, you may be asked if you want to Trim Redundant\nEntries. If you answer Yes, redundant entries will be removed automatically. It is\nbest to answer Yes when you are importing a main dictionary, as some other CAT\nsystems advise you to create redundant entries that can cause problems in Eclipse.\nFor a job dictionary, you should answer No, since they are unlikely to contain any\nredundant entries. (If you answer Yes, the redundant entries will be stored in a file\ncalled TRIMMED.DIX.)\nAs with text files, if you are converting from another CAT system, it is best to\nexport the .ictionary to RTF from that CAT system.\nYou do not have to import pre-Version 4 dictionaries into Version 4. You will be\nautomatically prompted to do this when necessary.\nEclipse Version 8 dictionaries do have to be imported into Eclipse before they can\nbe used, even though they share the .DIX extension.\nImporting From Steno Files\n309\n392\n994 Eclipse Help\nIf a steno file is open, you can import an RTF, ASCII, or Eclipse Version 8\nsteno file into your existing steno file. The imported steno will be appended.\n23.30 Input Tab\nWriter setup: User settings\nInput Tab\nRELATES TO: User Settings , Read\nNotes , Realtime , Build Dictionary ,\nConvenience Key Disk .\nYour writer and the transcription environment play a large role in determining\nhow Eclipse reads your notes. If your writer is realtime-capable, your notes can be\nsent directly to your computer through a cable. Many writers also store notes on a\nvariety of storage media, such as floppy disks, PCMCIA cards, SD cards, USB drives,\nor even cassettes. To read such notes, you might be able to transfer the storage\nmedia itself from the writer to the computer (put the floppy disk or PCMCIA card in\nyour computer and read the notes from it), or you might need to dump the notes to\nthe computer via a cable.\nSetting up Eclipse to read your notes\nSetting up Eclipse to read notes is usually a simple task and one youâll need to\ndo only once unless you change writers. The necessary settings are saved as part of\nyour user settings, so unless you change writers or the way notes are stored, you\nwonât need to change those settings. If your work requires you to read notes in more\nthan one way (such as over a cable for realtime jobs and from a disk for conventional\njobs), you can create a separate user setting (called a user profile) for each situation.\nNote: Your writer may have additional controls that need to be set when reading\nnotesâcheck your writerâs documentation for such information.\nGo to User Settings/Input to specify how Eclipse receives steno input, either\nfor reading notes or realtime .\n224\n99\n230 483 151\n40\n230 483\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 995\nInput Options\nSelect your brand of steno machine from the Writer drop-down list. Next, tell\nEclipse where the notes will be coming from. There are two settings, Read from: and\nRealtime from:, since you could use a different input method for each process. You\ncan select also \"None\" for either of these.\nThe Realtime From drop-down list tells Eclipse how your writer is connected to\nthe computer, for purposes of doing realtime . Select COM port, USB port, TCP/IP,\nDrive or folder, or Connection Magic .\nThe Read Notes From drop-down list tells Eclipse where to look for note files\nthat you read in via the read notes command. Select COM port, USB port, TCP/IP,\nDrive or Folder, or Session server.\n932\n483\n532\n230\n996 Eclipse Help\nThere are two Setup buttons, one each for Realtime From and Read Notes\nFrom. If you are doing realtime and/or reading notes from a COM port, the Setup\nbutton opens the COMM Setup dialog, where you can input the COM port number\nyour writer is connected to. If you're not sure what your COM port number is, see the\npage on realtime hardware considerations .\nNote: If your writer is \"Speech\", the Realtime From: Setup button opens the\nSpeech Options dialog.\nIf you are reading notes from a Drive or Folder, the Setup button allows you to\nbrowse to and select the drive letter or folder you are reading from. Usually, notes are\nread from a floppy disk; in this case, you need only select the letter of the floppy\ndrive (usually A:). This selection also designates the location of your floppy drive for\nother tasks, such as Convenience Key Disk , and the Floppy tab in the File\nManager .\nIf you are reading notes or doing Realtime using Realtime from/USB, clicking\nthe Setup button opens the Device Manager as a convenience so you can check if the\ndevice is present. You do not need to use the Setup button for additional settings.\nIf you read notes through a COM port:\n1. Attach the writerâs cable to a COM port on your computer.\n2. If you arenât already in User Settings, open it (Alt+U), then click the Input\ntab.\n3. Select COM port in the Read from: field.\n4. Click the Setup button to the right of the Read from: field. The Com port\nsetup dialog window appears.\n5. In the Port field, select the number of the COM port you are using.\n6. If you have already selected your writer type, the Baud Rate field will contain\nthe correct baud rate for your writer.\n7. Click OK. The COM port setup dialog disappears and you will again see the\nUser Settings/Input tab.\nNote: If a COM port is unplugged or disappears, (which can happen when a\nUSB-to-serial adapter is unplugged) Eclipse will periodically attempt to close and reopen\nthe port in order to try to re-establish the connection.\nIf you are using TCP/IP, you will be prompted to enter an Internet address and a\nport number, similar to what you would do when doing remote scoping via Internet\n. No writers currently support this, but it is used by the Eclipse Steno Link feature.\nKeyboard Layout refers to the key arrangement of your steno machine. The\ndefault is English; other key arrangements are possible. Select the language you are\nusing. The available keyboard layouts are Standard, Speech, Spanish, Continental,\nGerman, Michela, Italian, Russian, Greek, Portuguese, Palantype A, Palantype B,\nCustom Standard, Custom Russian, Custom Turkish. For more on Foreign language\nkeyboards and translation options, see the Writer help page\nThe Key map button is used to customize you keyboard layout. It is described in\ndetail in the Writer help page.\n947\n484\n1173\n40\n677\n529\n932\n932\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 997\nTesting Realtime\nThe Test button allows you to test your realtime connection. If the connection is\nsuccessful, the Adjust writer window will appear, and you'll be able to write into it:\nSpecialty Strokes\nSpecialty strokes are commands you can exceute from your steno machine.\nAssign these commands here. NOTE: each command must be a one-stroke entry, and\ncannot conflict with any entry in your dictionary (with one exception).\nDelete is the delete stroke. The default stroke is the asterisk key.\nAutomark is useful for marking a position in your notes. You may then\nsearch for the automarks, in either the text file or the note file .\nThe Display text box below the Automark button dictates how the Automark\nstroke will look. You can set this to any text you like. The default is (Mark). If you set\nit to {NULL}, it will allow you to have a spot marked in your document WITHOUT it\nshowing up as words that need to be deleted or that you don't want to display on a\nrealtime client's screen. To return to the spot, use Hyperkeys v (for forward) and r (for\nreverse), and select choice F, which searches for a flagged spot. A flagged spot is\nanywhere in your document where an AutoMark was inserted.\nThe Automark stroke is also used when building a dictionary .\nThe Keymode and Correction strokes allows you to toggle these modes on and\noff. Keymode and Correction Mode are used in realtime editing .\nThe Division stroke is used to separate jobs on older writers that do not divide\njobs among multiple files.\n320 694 224\n151\n494\n998 Eclipse Help\nThe Spell Mode stroke will toggle Spell Mode on and off. When it is on, your\nwriter keys will be used to fingerspell words, rather than translating against your\ndictionaries. If Capitalize spell mode is checked, these will appear as capital letters.\nThe Stitch Mode stroke will toggle Stitch Mode on and off. When it is on,\nanything you write will be S-T-I-T-C-H-E-D. If Capitalize stitch mode is checked,\nthese will appear as capital letters. If you are captioning, or using CART, and need a\nword to appear stitched immediately, you can hit {STITCH} and follow it with any\ndictionary entry, which will appear stitched. The metadictionary entry for this is:\n{STITCH}={/?STN}\nWhen using spell mode or stitch mode, every stroke is interpreted phonetically,\nmeaning that you can fingerspell something like âwidgetâ with two strokes (WEUD\nTKPWET) instead of six. Normally, you have to hit the spell mode or stitch mode\ntoggle stroke to turn them off. In these modes, as a backup in case you misstroke or\nforget to toggle it off, hitting certain extremely common strokes is used by the\nsoftware as an indication that you are done spelling. The strokes are those in the\nTranslation Magic rules list, which you can edit.\nVISUALIZERS:\nD3 - Realtime Setup\nD3 - Add Serial Port\nD3 - Device Manager\nD1a - Extended Steno\nD1a - Steno KeyMap\nD1a - Extended Steno Dictionary\n23.31 Info bar\nThe Info bar\nRELATES TO: AutoMagic , Auto-Brief , View\ntoggles\nWhen you first open Eclipse (version 5 or later), you will see an area on the left\nside of your Eclipse window, that contains several features. They will appear as\nneeded when you are performing various tasks in Eclipse.\n883\n52 500\n116\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 999\nIn the Info bar, you can choose to display any or all of these features:\nÂ· AutoMagic choices\nÂ· Translation Statistics\nÂ· Auto-briefs\nÂ· A Waveform display when recording audio\nYou can go to the View toggles dialog to select the options you want in the\nInfo bar, including whether or not to display it.\n1000 Eclipse Help\nThe View toggles dialog can be opened several ways: use the Window\nmenu/View toggles, or User settings/Display/View toggles, or right-click inside\nthe Info bar itself. Each user settings file will separately remember if the Info bar is\non or off, so you can have it on for some settings and off for others.\nSize\nWith the info bar on, you may want to decrease your zoom level in the editing\ndisplay, or resize the info bar by clicking and dragging the right side of the bar.\nYou can also shrink the info bar font if you want to fit more text in less space. Be\naware that the text that appears in the info bar changes depending on the context, so\nyou will want to be careful about making it too small. Certain items, such as the autobriefs,\nwill word-wrap, but others will display text with the ... to indicate that there is\nmore text than is displayed.\nInfo bar settings in View toggles\nIn the Info bar settings area, you can customize the way you want your\ninformation to display.\nÂ· The AutoMagic check box turns AutoMagic on or off.\nÂ· Turning off the Use numbers option disables the use of numbers to activate\ncommands, although they remain visible in the Info bar. It is recommended that\nyou leave the Use numbers option on. Note that with this option turned on, the\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1001\nnumber keys can be used to select options, but you will have to use the \"type in\ntext\" function (Ctrl+N or Hyperkey N) to actually type numbers.\nÂ· If you turn Use numbers off, you will be able to select most options using their\nhotkeys, but you will only be able to select an option that is NOT a command (such\nas Convert) by clicking it, or by using the AutoMagic hotkeys, Alt+1, Alt+2 ... Alt+0.\nThe 10 AutoMagic hotkeys are all available in new installations, but if you have an\nexisting .ini file, and want to use them, you will have to go to User settings/Edit\ntab/Keyboard, and modify the keystrokes.\nÂ· Hotkeys - you can turn off the AutoMagic hotkeys to save space. This option is good\nfor experienced users who already know all the hotkeys and just like the timesaving\nsuggestions.\nÂ· Check Pop-up if you want a Pop-up box with the Info bar choices appearing in your\ndocument area. This will be especially useful if you want to turn the info bar off\nentirely to save screen space.\nÂ· The Delay time setting allows you to adjust the amount of time in milliseconds\nbefore the information appears in the Info bar.\nÂ· The Font setting will change the font use for all items displayed in the Info bar\nexcept for the auto-briefs, which have their own font setting.\nÂ· You can have your Translation statistics displayed in the Info bar. Note the\nSetup.. button next to the Translation stats checkbox. This opens a dialog that\nallows you to select what items are displayed. This is the same dialog that you get\nwhen you right-click on the realtime statistics window. If you put the statistics in\nthe info bar, you can permanently close the statistics window and make more space\navailable on your screen.\nÂ· There is an option to display the Auto-briefs in the info bar. If you click on the\nauto-briefs in the info bar, it will open the auto-brief dictionary.\nÂ· When you're recording audio, if you have Translation stats turned on in the info bar,\nwith audio checked, normally you'll get a level indicator, just as you would on the\nrealtime statistics window. If you would prefer a waveform display, you can select\nWaveform display, and on the bottom of the Info window, in a re-sizable box, you'll\nget a visual display of the actual audio waveform with peaks and valleys. This type\nof display makes it easier to see if you're getting a faint signal, or if you're getting a\nvery loud signal that's causing distortion. It will show either the waveform or VU\nmeter only when there is a recording in progress. The audio display will not appear\nin the info bar if you are not showing the translation statistics, or if you are, but\nhave the audio selection turned off.\n1002 Eclipse Help\n23.32 Install Lesson\nInstall Lesson\nSupport/Install lesson\nRELATES TO: Working With Lesson Player ,\nLesson Player .\nThe Support menu/Install lesson option installs a text file as a lesson.

The Tran stats.. button opens the Status dialog,\nlisting the number of Enries, Untranslates, Conflicts, WPM, etc. for the\ntranscript. The Editing time feature shows the total amount of time you\nhave spent editing the job, down to the second. Note that this covers the\nentire time the job has been open, so it will count time spent writing the job\nin realtime or time spent on a coffee break if you leave the job open on your\nscreen.\nIn addition to calculating content statistics, this dialog shows a complete\nlist of all print commands in the document, including comment lines left by a\nscopist or proofreader. (The only exception is conditional page breaks, of\nwhich there are many in a document, and it is not useful to list them.) The\nlist has page/line numbers by each print command.\nYou can select any item on the list and click on the Go to cmd button to\njump immediately to that spot in the transcript.

The display will show how many words were said in each\nwords-per-minute category, from 0 to 500, in increments of 10.\nFlesch Readability scores have also been added to the Job report. Note\nthat this is skewed by the tendency for transcripts to contain many short\nparagraphs, particularly during Q&A, so instead of counting sentences, this\ncounts each paragraph as a sentence so that longer paragraphs containing\nmultiple sentences help balance out the tendency for many short paragraphs.\nThis metric is generally approximate even in the best case, of course.\n23.35 Job Variables\nJob Variables\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1007\nShift+Alt+V\nTools/Job variables\nThe Tools menu/Job variables option displays a list of variables in the\ncurrent job, and their current value.

This avoids the problems that come up if\nyou ever re-assign a keystroke that was used in the macro. For details see Macros:\nKeystrokes versus Commands .\nTyping text. If your macro is going to type text into a transcript, you must\ninclude the Type Text command at the beginning, and the Enter keystroke at the end.\nThis ensures that the macro will work regardless of whether your hyperkeys are\nactive. If you are using hyperkeys, the Type Text command will suspend them before\nthe text is typed, and the Enter key will reactivate them. If you are not using\nhyperkeys, these steps will have no effect. Thus, the macro will work at all times.\nThe active window. If your macro is a realtime editing macro, you need to\nmake sure that the realtime job is the active window before executing the macro\nsteps. To do this, begin each realtime editing macro with the Esc keystroke, followed\nby the Translate Notes command. This is the same Translate Notes command you\nuse to begin a realtime job (Alt+T); if you execute this command while already in a\nrealtime job, it will make the realtime job the active window. This assures that any\nrealtime macros designed to affect the realtime job will go to the right place.\n436\n441\n1018\n1023\n683\n269\n1014 Eclipse Help\nAccount for the cursor position. Any editing macro will take effect starting\nfrom the current cursor location. This can vary, so if you want the macro to act the\nsame way each time, you need to know where the cursor is when the macro begins.\nFor example, if a macro is supposed to affect the most recent untranslate, you need to\nthrow in a Bottom of Job command to put the cursor at the end of the file, before the\nsteps in the macro begin.\nUse Alt keys instead of Tabbing around dialogs. To \"click\" buttons on\ndialogs, you should use the Alt+underlined letter keystroke, rather than a series of\nTab keystrokes to shift the focus to the item. If you use Tab keystrokes, future\nupdates to the program may cause the macro not to work, because the look of the\ndialog (and thus the number of tabs necessary to execute the macro properly) can\nchange. Tabs should only be used in macros as explained in the next item:\nAlt and Text boxes..If your macro includes an Alt keystroke, to \"click\"\nsomething in a dialog, the cursor must not be a text box at the time. Include a Tab or\nShift+Tab in the macro to move the focus somewhere else before executing the Alt\nkeystroke. For example, the macro to capitalize a global in the globaling window\nis simply Alt+C. But the focus is on the text box where you type the global definition.\nSo for the macro to work, you need to Tab off of the text box first, so the macro is two\nsteps: Tab followed by Alt+C.\nRetransmit text. If this is a realtime editing macro, it is good practice to include\nthe Retransmit Text command, to ensure that the realtime edit will apply to any\nrealtime output you may be doing.\nRecursive macros. A macro should never be assigned to a keystroke that is in\nthe macro itself. If it is, executing the macro may generate an endless loop.\nCommands must have a keystroke assigned to them. If a macro includes a\ncommand, that command must have a keystroke assigned to it. If not, the command\n(and by extension, the entire macro) will not work.\nVISUALIZERS:\nC1 - Keyboard Changes\nG5 - Macros\n23.41 Macros Dialog\nKeyboard Macros dialog\n331\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1015\nThe Macros dialog, which you can open by going to User settings, Edit tab, and\npressing the Macro button, contains a list of all the macros you have available.

This allows you to assign menu slots to custom functions.\nTo assign a macro to a menu slot, change its name to match the\nnumber of the slot you wish to use. The first menu item will execute a macro\ncalled Macro1, the second one will execute Macro2, etc., through Macro15. Go\nto the macros dialog to rename macros.\nIf you want the macro name to be more descriptive, follow the Macro1\nname with a pipe, and descriptive text, like this: \"Macro1|Description\". Note\nthat the Description will only use the first 10 characters of the macro name.\n23.44 Macros: Keystrokes versus Commands\nKeystrokes Versus Commands\nin Macros\nRELATES TO: Macro editor .\n1014\n1018\n1024 Eclipse Help\nWhen creating a macro, you should always use a command if available. For most\nmacros you can use either keystrokes or commands for each of the individual steps in\nthe macro, but using commands avoids problems especially when sharing macros\nwith friends.\nA keystroke, as the name implies, is a key (or combination of keys) entered from\nthe keyboard, such as Alt+T, Ctrl+G, Enter, or simply the B key.\nA command is a built-in Eclipse task, such as Open Text, Translate Notes, or\nGlobal.\nWhen creating a macro, it is best to use Commands wherever possible. Use\nkeystrokes only when working in dialogs, or when typing something.\nFor example, here is the default macro for choosing a conflict in realtime:\nMost of the actions are in the form of commands. Only Escape (to confirm that all\ndialogs are closed at the beginning of the macro) and 1 (to pick conflict choice 1) are\nkeystrokes.\nYou could also create the macro this way:\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1025\nThis is the same series of steps, but with keystroke equivalents instead of\ncommands: Alt+T instead of Translate Notes, Ctrl+Page Down instead of Bottom of\nJob, etc. However, if anyone using this macro reassigns their keystrokes in any way,\nthe macro will not work. For that reason it is preferable to use Commands whenever\napplicable.\nNOTE: a command MUST have a keystroke assigned to it to work successfully in a\nmacro. For example, if you want to add the command Switch Utilities to a macro,\nyou will have to assign it a keystroke first.\nVISUALIZERS:\nC1 - Keyboard Changes\nG5 - Macros\n23.45 Macro Groups\nMacro Groups\nMacro Groups are a way to assign multiple macros to one keystroke. You\npress the keystroke to pick the group, then you press a second keystroke to\nselect the exact macro you want from the list.\nCreating A Macro Group\n1086\n1008\n1026 Eclipse Help\nA Macro Group is defined by the name you give the macro in the Macro\nEditor . To create a macro group, use the following syntax:\n{GroupName:MacroName} So whenever you see a macro name in\nbraces, it is part of a macro group.\nThe GroupName is the name of the macro group. The MacroName is the\nname of each macro within that group. These are the names that appear in\nthe list.\nThe first character of the MacroName is the keystroke you will press to\nexecute that macro. So each MacroName within a group must start with a\ndifferent letter. Note also that there are no spaces before or after the colon.\nYou can assign a keystroke to any one of the macros in the group, (it\ndoesn't matter which one) and hitting that keystroke will open the group.\nThe keystroke assigned to the group will appear the macro you assigned it to,\nsurrounded by brackets: [].\nIn this example of a macro group, the keystroke is [Hyp B] so pressing\nhyperkey b opens the list of block moves. Typing the letter for each item\nperforms that task. So, hyperkey b, followed by w will copy the selection to a\nnew file.\nAssigning Keystrokes To A Macro Group\n1018\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1027\nOnce you've created a macro group, assign a keystroke to any one\nmacro in the group, just as you would assign a keystroke to an individual\nmacro . Only assign the keystroke to one macro of the group, not every\nmacro in the group.\nUsing a Macro Group\nOnce you've created a macro group, you can execute any macro within\nthe group by pressing a two-keystroke sequence.\nThe first keystroke is the keystroke you assigned to the group, as\nexplained above. The second keystroke is the first character in the name of\nthe macro.\nFor example, here is the Convert macro group:\n1020\n1028 Eclipse Help\nTo use this group, you would first press assign one of the macros in the\ngroup to a standard key or hyperkey . When using it, you press that key.\nA menu of all macros within the group will appear:\nThe text that appears in the menu is simply the MacroName, the part\nthat appears after the colon. The first character and the name is the key you\npush to select that individual macro. From the above menu, you would press\n1 if you wanted a Quantity, G for Generic Digits, H for Superscript, etc.\nYou can use a macro group in an autoreplacement. Since macro groups\nare indicated using braces, the {M:name} syntax in autoreplacements\ncreates confusion. You can, however, use {M:<macroname>} if that macro is\npart of a group as a substitution for the braces.\n23.46 Macro Variables\nMacro Variables\nMacro variables are used when you need to type something in the middle of the\nexecution of a macro.\nFor example, if you wanted to create a Global that would insert Prospective Juror\nX where X changes every time you use the global, you would create a macro that\nincluded a macro variable.\nTo do this, first record the macro, typing X where you want to insert the variable\nnumber when you run the macro.

If the name you type already exists, the job notes will be appended\nto (added to the end of) the existing file. Eclipse will give you a warning if\nyou are about to append a file. Use the Browse button to see a file list of\nexisting Eclipse note files. If you do not enter a name in this field, a prompt\nwill appear, notifying you to do so. You canât proceed with reading notes until\nyouâve entered a file name. ( Eclipse needs to know where to put the notes.)\n6. After entering the file name, click the Read button.

There are 2 levels available: Protected on the display,\nand further protected on printouts and exported files.\nYou can mark a piece of text and use the Format menu/Document\nutility/Set text type/Redacted to set it to redacted text.\nThen, for the first level of protection, you can set the Display colors in\nUser settings/Display/Color selections/Redacted text so that the\ninformation in the redacted text will be protected on your screen.\nThe background color is always used for the screen. The foreground color\nis used for the screen AND for the printout. For example, if you have your\nforeground color set to black, then redacted text will show up as a black box,\nas though it were blacked out with a thick marker. If you set your foreground\ntext to white, it will print blank as though it were whited out. The background\ncolor should be set to a contrasting color so that you will still be able to read\nand edit it on the screen. For example, if you want your redacted text to be\nwhite, you should set your redacted text background color to be something\nother than white, such as gray.\nSecondly, in User settings/Document/Advanced you can choose to\nOmit redacted text, Show only redacted text, or have All text visible.\nWhen Omit redacted text is on, all redacted text will be eliminated from the\nprintout, PDF, ASCII and Bridge exports. If you select All text visible,\nredacted text will appear as normal. Each individual document will remember\nthis setting separately.\nThe option to Show only redacted text causes the document to only\nshow the redacted text and omit everything else, substituting the x or space\nor black bar for the normal text. You can use this with the \"Omit empty\npages function\" so that you can print a transcript that contains only the\npages that contain redacted text, and it will only show the redacted text from\nthose pages, but the page and line numbers will still match the original.\nThe Omit empty pages checkbox can be used when you have a large\nsection of redacted text that would cause a number of blank pages to appear.\nCheck this to skip over those pages.\n1046 Eclipse Help\nUnder User settings/Document/Advanced, you can choose a color for\nthe redacted text, or set the redacted text character so that you can have\nredacted text appear as XXXX or **** or whatever you like. Click the\nRedacted text color button to open the Color selections dialog.\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1047\nNote: You can use a dictionary entry to have confidential information\ntranslate as redacted text. The three-letter metadictionary code for redacted\ntext is /?TXR. The recommended metadictionary entry for redacted text is:\n{R:*}={/\"%/?TXR}. This will allow you to do {R:text} and \"text\" will appear\nredacted. For example, if you have a person's name that should be\nconfidential, you could enter it as Mr.{R:Jones} or {R:Mr. Jones}.\nOption to remove redacted text entirely\nUnder some circumstances, you may need to prepare a version of the\njobname.ecl file that has the redacted text removed completely. Rather than\nrisk ruining the original file, this feature allows you to block mark as much of\na transcript as you want (including the entire thing) and then use\nBlock/Write. If you block write part of a transcript that is set to hide\nredacted text, you will be asked if you wish to redact the text in the writtenout\nblock. If you answer yes, then the text will actually be changed to the\nredacted text character, such as an X or *.\nContinuous redacted text mode for translation\nYou may want to write in redacted text for a long period, such as a\nbench conference. You can disable realtime output, but you may also want to\nobscure what appears on your own screen. Depending on your display colors,\nyou can make it so that redacted text is not visible even on your own screen.\nOne thing to be careful of is that redacted text is a text type, just like\ntranslated text, typed-in text, untranslates, conflicts and form fields. If you\ntell the software to treat everything you write as redacted text, all of these\nother types will be overwritten while that mode is on since a piece of text\ncannot have multiple types. Conflicts in that mode cannot be selected, etc.\nThe redacted text mode, like many other modes in the software (such\nas literal case) has dictionary entries for ON, OFF and TOGGLE in case you\nwant to use one entry to turn it both on and off (not recommended.)\nThe suggested dictionary entries are {REDACTON} {REDACTOFF} and\n{REDACTTOGGLE} and use the following metadictionary entries:\n{REDACTON}={/?RDO}\n{REDACTOFF}={/?RDF}\n{REDACTTOGGLE}={/?RDT}\nThese metadictionary entries are part of the default .set file as of\nVersion 7.\n1048 Eclipse Help\n23.59 Restore\nRestore\nTools/Restore..\nRELATES TO: Backup .\nThe Restore command will restore file(s) that have been previously backed up\nwith the Backup command.\nTo restore files:\n1.

So. for example, a superscript set to 75 / -\n100 will be 75% of the size of normal text, and will move up 100 twips\nhigher than normal text.\nThe items on this dialog may be used in any combination. For example,\nyou may create text that is bold, italic, and subscripted, simply by checking\nall three of those boxes. The only thing you can't do is subscript and\nsuperscript at the same time.\nThis dialog may also be used to remove existing formatting. To change\nbold-faced text back to normal, mark the bolded text, select Text Attributes,\nand uncheck Bold from the Text Attributes dialog.\n1062 Eclipse Help\n23.69 Text Files\nTEXT FILES\nRELATES TO: Open Text , Editing ,\nBlock Files .\nA text file can be a transcript, block file , or list file .

In a text global, you will assign a definition to another piece of text.\nFor example, if you text-global the surname \"Smith\" as \"Smythe\", all instances\nof \"Smith\" will be changed to \"Smythe\", no matter how you write them.\nTo create a text global from within a transcript:\n1. Mark the text.\n2. Initiate the global command.\n3. The globaling window will appear. Check the \"Text\" box in the global window,\nwhich always defaults to off.\n4. Enter your desired definition, and select a destination (Main, Job, Trash, Local,\nUser, or Browse ).\n86 306\n548\n548 556\n971\n269 85\n483\n548 556 86\n224\n326\n394\n326\n328\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1063\n5. If you have block-marked text that is typed-in (where no steno is available,),\nand then hit the global function, it automatically detects that you are most likely\ndoing a text global, so the text box will be checked by default.\nYou can start a global without first marking the text, using the global dialog to\nhighlight the text you wish to replace, and then check the \"Text\" box in the dialog\nafter making the selection.\nYou can also add a text global to a dictionary via the Add Dictionary Entry\n(Ctrl+D) command:\n1. Open the dictionary you wish to add the text global to.\n2. Add Dictionary Entry .\n3. When the steno emulator appears, press Escape without entering any\nsteno.\n4. You will be asked to enter a Text Entry Search String. Enter the text you wish to\nbe replaced (\"Smith\" in the above example).\n5. You will be asked to enter a Text Entry Replace String. Enter the text you wish\nto replace it with (\"Smythe\" in the above example).\n6. The entry will be added to the dictionary.\nText globals will always appear at the bottom of the dictionary. In the Steno\ncolumn, they are surrounded by quotation marks.\nBy default, a text global will be a Trash global , meaning that it will take\neffect in the current job only. However, you can add text globals to dictionaries by\ndoing a Main, Job, or User global .\nVISUALIZERS:\nF3 - Text Globals\nF3a - Text Global Location\n23.71 Timekeeper\nTimekeeper\nCtrl+Shift+K\n672 173\n173\n893\n328\n328\n1064 Eclipse Help\nTools/Timekeeper..\nThe Timekeeper function allows you to produce a report that shows the\ntime taken by each speaker and each speaker group.

Setting these\noptions can make the translation and editing process faster and more efficient.\nYou can set many of these options in your User Settings (Alt+U), which you\ncan also access by clicking the User settings button ( ) in the Translate notes\ndialog. These settings are saved and used, by default, whenever you translate in\nEclipse, until you change them. In other words, you need to set them only once.\nThe dictionaries can be changed in the Translate notes dialog , overriding the\nUser Settings for just that job. If, however, you change the Main dictionary in the\nTranslate notes dialog, you will make that same main dictionary change in User\nSettings.\n275\n1068 Eclipse Help\nTo create settings for translations, go to User settings (Alt+U)/Translate .\nTranslating a Note File\n1.

Eclipse will, by default, assign the same name to the\ntext file. Then, click the Text button, and change the default name to something else.\nThis is useful if you are retranslating a note file, but do not wish to overwrite the\nexisting text file.\nOptions on the Translate Notes dialog\nÂ· Under Translate modes, choose one of the following:\n244\n224 969\n955\n285\n532\n226\n947\n520\n244\n969\n955\n649 285\n532\n224 694\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1069\nÂ· Tran and edit: Translates an existing note file and allows you to edit the text\nfile (translation) while it is still being translated. When editing while\ntranslating, the text document opens when the translation begins, and you can\nimmediately begin editing it. Note that although Tran and edit mode is\nconvenient, it will slow the translation process.\nÂ· Quick tran: Translates an existing note file when you donât want or need to\nedit during translation. Does not allow you to see the text file until it is\ncomplete, but translation goes faster. A progress bar will appear to inform\nyou of the progress of the translation\nÂ· Realtime: Begins a realtime job.\nÂ· Virtual realtime: Translates an existing note file, but it behaves like a\nrealtime job. Specifically, any realtime output options you have in place will\nbe utilized. For example, this would allow you to test your CIC or\ncaptioning output without having a writer handy. You would select Virtual\nrealtime, pick an existing note file, and see if the output works. Virtual\nrealtime is a diagnostic tool, and not a way to produce a new transcript. When\nyou start, it opens a control panel that allows you to step through a\ntranslation, by using a Stop button, a Pause button, and a Next stroke button.\nYou can step through a translation one stroke at a time by pressing the Next\nstroke button, or you can let it roll by unpausing it. You can pause it at any\ntime if you want to go back to viewing the translation one stroke at a time,\nand you can use the Stop button at any time to stop the translation\naltogether.\nÂ· Record audio: Check this box to record and synchronize audio during a\nrealtime translation. (This option is not available unless the Realtime\ntranslation mode checkbox is marked.) See the page on working with audio\nfor further discussion. Applies to Realtime jobs only.\nYou can right-click in the Realtime status window, and use the Configuration\nmenu to customize how it looks. Each item in the window can be selected or\ndeselected by clicking on the appropriate checkbox. The window will resize to fit the\nremaining indicators. You can also choose to arrange the items vertically (the default)\nor horizontally.\n694\n1040\n483\n519\n519\n666\n649\n1070 Eclipse Help\nIn addition to the untranslates count, there is a Unique untranslates count\ntelling you how many different untranslates you have written in the current file, rather\nthan the total number. For example, if you write TKAEUF, TKAEUF, PWEPB, PWEPB,\nTPHRO, that would count as 5 untranslates, but only 3 unique untranslates. A total\nand percentage are supplied. Uncheck the box in the Configuration menu if you do not\nwant to use the Unique count.\nÂ· Phonetic untranslates: If checked, any untranslated steno will appear in its\nphonetic form. (In User Settings/Translate you can set the Phonetic typeâ\nBasic or Intelligent.) If unchecked, the raw steno will appear. It is advisable to\ncheck this if you are doing captioning or any kind of realtime output\n(since most viewers will not be able to read steno, but will get the gist from\nthe phonetics).\nAn example of a phonetic equivalent is âmanâ for the steno PHAPB. In the\nPhonetic type field, select Basic or Intelligent phonetics. Basic phonetics would\ntranslate PHAEUBG as âmayk.â When intelligent phonetics is selected, Eclipse uses the\nphonetics and the spelling dictionary to guess the correct translation. Using intelligent\nphonetics would translate PHAEUBG as âmake.â\nBasic and intelligent phonetics use the Phonetics table found on the User\nsettings/Programming tab to display untranslates. You can modify your Phonetics\ntable to match your steno theory. See the Phonetics Table help page for details.\nAlso, see the Visualizer (C1 - below) on Phonetics Table Customization.\nÂ· Enable output: If you have made any selections in Output Formats ,\nEclipse will send the realtime job to those recipients. Applies to Realtime and\nVirtual Realtime jobs only. It determines whether or not to use the output\nformats, so with this checkbox you can disable the output formats for this\nparticular translation without having to change your User settings.\n666 519\n826\n858\n520\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1071\nNote that if Enable output is turned off, you can start realtime without\nestablishing any connection whatsoever to the output system. Then, when you're\nready to start, use the Tools/Edit toggles/RT Output ON option (or the suspend\ntoggle macro) and at that point, the system will start the initialization process for the\noutput system. This sequence of operations allows you to start realtime in order to do\ndictionary prep and practice ahead of time and only start the output when you're\nready, without having to restart the realtime entirely.\nÂ· Prompt for starting stroke: If you turn this off, it will always start from the\nlast stroke in the writer. Note that this option is permanently stored and will\nthen apply to the use of the \"Instant realtime\" button, as well.\nÂ· Share document with Connection Magic - with this turned on, when you\nstart a translation, the Session settings dialog will open, and you can enter a\npassword and choose to make it publicly visible or not for a scopist. If you\ncheck this box, it will stay checked until you change it.\n532\n1072 Eclipse Help\nÂ· Initial block and Final block: If you have block files that you want\ninserted at the beginning and/or end of your transcript, you can have them\nincluded during translation. Mark the Initial block or Final block checkbox, as\nrelevant. To indicate which file to use for the initial or final block, click the\nrelevant button. You will then get a file dialog from which you can specify the\nEclipse text file. The current block file selections are listed to the right of the\nInitial block and Final block buttons. Initial block files will be sent along with\nyour document to your output system, such as LiveNote, CaseView or Bridge.\nSee Visualizer\nÂ· The Dictionaries button will open the dictionaries dialog , from which\nadditional dictionaries can be selected for use in translation.\nÂ· The gear button will take you to the Realtime Tab of User Settings .\nIf you want the Realtime Status Window to appear, showing the number of\nentries, untranslates, conflicts , unresolved conflicts, and words per minute, open\nthe View toggles, and check the Realtime statistics box.

When\nchecked, will automatically insert a lock-space between titles and names, such as\nMrs.{~}Smith, and between numbers and measurements, such as 10{~}pounds.\nUntran Borders - If you want to enclose untranslates in parentheses or another\ncharacter, type the desired character in the two Untran borders fields. Type the\nopening character in the field to the left of KPH-PL and the closing character in the\nfield to the right of it. Type only one character in each field. This will not affect\nglobaling in any way; it is an aesthetic choice only.\nIf Phonetic Untranslates is checked, your untranslates will appear\nphonetically. If not, they will appear as raw steno. The pending translation will also be\nphonetic, independent of the Translation Magic setting. The User\nsettings/realtime/pending translation display is controlled by whether User\nsettings/translate/phonetic untranslates is on or off-- if it is on, you will see the\nphonetics before it translates, instead of the raw steno. Turn it off to see the raw\nsteno\nYou may select either Basic or Intelligent phonetics from the Phonetic Type list.\nWhen Intelligent phonetics are selected, Eclipse will use the rules in the Phonetics\nTable to attempt to correctly spell the word. You can modify your Phonetics table to\nmatch your steno theory.\nBasic will give you a simple phonetics, and will not attempt to spell the word\ncorrectly.\n378\n326\n858\n1074 Eclipse Help\nIf Suppress Untranslates is checked, untranslates will act like normal text.\nThat is, the untranslate color will be the same as your regular text, and you will\nNOT be able to scan to them. When it is off, untranslates will continue to appear in\nuntranslate text, no matter what the color, so that you can still detect and scan to\nthem.\nInsert Missing By-Lines - If you fail to write a by-line in a situation where it\nis called for, the Insert Missing By-Lines feature, if checked, will insert it for you,\nusing the last By line that was written. As long as you write the first by-whom\nindication, {S:MR. SMITH}{Q} for example, from that point forward any {Q} that is\nwritten that doesn't follow an answer or answer paragraph will automatically have a\nby format applied to it.\nIt will default to using the QS by format, typically defined as âQ (By Mr. Smith)â\nbut if you would prefer that it use the SQ by format, simply leave blank the QS by\nformat template in the settings under User settings/Edit/âByâ formats .\nThis feature will supply missing answer by lines as well as missing question by\nlines, and will correctly supply the appropriate speaker separator in each case.\nIf a missing by line is detected before any manual by lines have been written,\nthe software will supply a default name instead of a âByâ with no name at all. For Q by\nlines, the default name will be âQUESTIONERâ and for A by lines, the default name\nwill be âWITNESS.â Note that either of these can be replaced with whatever you wish\nby specifying a replacement in the speaker table for this exact text.\nTuck Punctuation Inside Quotes will tuck commas, periods, and suffixes\n(including the suffix \"'s\") inside quotation marks. For example, if you write âwidgetâ\nfollowed by {^ize} you will get âwidgetizeâ or if you write âNewsweekâ followed by\n{^'s} you will get âNewsweek's.â\nNote that the 's suffix can be written as {^'s} like any other suffix rather than\nhaving to define it differently as 's or {'s}. In fact, in order to have it work for the\ntuck function, it must be defined as a suffix.\nTuck punctuation is disabled following a digit. So if someone says [he was about\nfive feet eight inches] it would translate as [He was about 5'8\"] and not [He was\nabout 5'8.\"].\nIf you turn Integral affix on, the translator will attempt to apply the integral\nprefixes and suffixes during translation (including Realtime) rather than only using\nthem during globaling or adding a dictionary entry. For example, if you have \"EBGS\nPERT = expert\" in your main dictionary, you can write EBGS PERTS and get \"experts\"\neven if that definition is not in your dictionary.\nNote that it does require that the resulting word be a correctly spelled one or it\nwon't apply the integral prefix or suffix.\nThis follows precisely the same rules as the integral prefixes and suffixes used\nduring globaling.\nThe system assumes that if you write TPHROB REUPB ARGD and you only have\nâTPHROB REUPB ARG = flobrinargâ in your dictionary, you were probably trying to\nwrite âflobrinarged.â\nFor details, see the Reference Guide .\n125\n339\n464\n464\n249\n846\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1075\nTo the right of the Integral affix option there is a Setup.. button that will\ndirectly open up the editor window for the Integral prefix and suffix steno\ndefinitions list, which is also found on the User settings/Programming tab.\nIntegral affix as: If a word is translated by virtue of the integral prefix/suffix\nfeature, you can choose a text type whose color will call attention to the fact that it\nwas translated without a perfect match in the dictionary. Select from the dropdown\nlist of text types: Normal, Untranslate, Conflict, Selected confilct, AI-selected conflict,\netc., or one of the 8 User-definable text types.\nConvert Answer To: - Often, reporters will write \"Answer\" when \"THE\nWITNESS\" is needed transitioning from colloquy to Q & A. To have Eclipse\nautomatically correct this, check the Convert ANSWER to: box and enter what you\nwant it to change to in the box to the right.\nIf a paragraph translates which is set to behave as âQuestionâ then the next\nanswer will be translated as an answer. If a paragraph translates which is set to\nbehave as âColloquyâ then the next answer will translate as âTHE WITNESSâ or\nwhatever you have typed in the Convert ANSWER to: box.\nTranslation Magic lets you write long words that you do not have defined in\nyour dictionary. Just write words phonetically and they'll translate correctly. Using\nTranslation magic in addition to Fix misstrokes during translation, will give you\nreliable translations for multi-stroke words containing misstrokes. It will apply\nDragged and Dropped keys to multiple steno strokes, and will ignore digits, Macros,\n{DELETE}, {FLUSH}, and automark. For details, see the Translation Magic help\npage and the related Visualizers .\nPick 1st Conflict Choice By Default will display only the first choice in a\nconflict , if the conflict cannot be resolved automatically. This is useful in\ncaptioning , and other realtime situations where it would be unwieldy for the\nviewers to see the entire conflict.\nPick 1st Conflict Choice By Default is simply a display setting. It is still\nconsidered an unresolved conflict, and no information will go to the conflict-resolution\nAI until you manually select it. Remember when creating conflicts to always insert the\nmost commonly appearing conflict first to get the greatest benefit from this feature.\nSuppress double paragraphs - This will convert any double paragraph label\ninto a simple continuation paragraph. In other words, if you are already in a Question\nor question continuation paragraph, then hitting a {Q} will change it into {N}\nautomatically.\nLikewise, hitting {A} will be changed to {N} if you're already within an answer,\nand hitting {S:Name} will change to {N} if you write a {S:Name} entry with exactly\nthe same name in it.\nThe Master Speaker List button will open the Speaker List , where you can\nmanage your speaker IDs before beginning a translation.\nNon-Capping Words is a list of words, separated by commas, that will not\ncapitalize as part of titles. For example, if you block mark the phrase \"a tale of two\ncities\", and then use the Upper Case command , the word \"of\" will not capitalize\nbecause it is in the Non-Capping Words list.\n869\n278\n278 249\n169\n666\n249\n394\n357\n1076 Eclipse Help\nNumber bar untrans feature causes all number bar entries to appear as\nuntranslates unless they are specifically defined in your dictionary, just like any other\nsteno stroke.\nNormally, Eclipse considers any number you write with the number bar that\ncontains only digits to be a valid translation, regardless of whether it appears in the\ndictionary or not. You may prefer that a number bar entry, even if it only contains\ndigits, to be considered an untranslate unless you specifically have a dictionary entry\nfor it.\nFor example, you may work with a theory in which you can hit two number keys\nat once to make numbers such as 23, but you never intentionally hit three numbers at\nonce, such as 234, and would like for this to appear as an untranslate.\nKeep in mind that if you turn this on and you do want to use the number bar\nintentionally, you will need to make dictionary entries (like 5 = 5) for every possible\nnumber bar stroke that you would write in your theory.\nMisstroke Setup\nIn your User settings/Translate tab you can enter the keys you most often\nmisstroke by dragging or dropping. When you turn on a misstroke correction feature,\nEclipse can automatically corrects some of these errors. All these options are on in the\nMisstroke Setup section (bottom half of the dialog).\nWhen evaluating a misstroke, Eclipse will sort by frequency, by (internally)\nmaking a list of all of the entries that the current untranslate could be a misstroke for\nand choosing the one that is used with the highest frequency, based on information in\nthe dictionary.\nIf Fix Misstrokes During Translation is checked, Eclipse will attempt to\ncorrect any misstrokes you write when globaling or during translation. The program\nwill use the Dragged Keys and Dropped Keys settings, trying one key at a time, until\nit finds a valid dictionary entry that is close to your misstroke. If a valid entry is\nfound, that entry will translate. The text will appear in the untranslate color you\ndesignate for untranslates (on the User Settings/Display tab), so that you can check\nthem during the editing process.\nTo set your Dragged Keys, click the Dragged Keys button. The steno emulator\nwill appear. Click only the keys you tend to drag. To de-select a key, click it again.\nWhen you are satisfied with your selections, click OK. The keys you chose will appear\nas text to the right of the Dragged Keys button.\nNote: If you do not use the number bar normally and generally hit it only by\naccident, you can turn on the number bar in your dragged keys, and any untran that\ncontains the number bar will attempt to translate without the number bar regardless\nof what other keys have been pressed (as long as the stroke is not all numbers, which\nwill still translate as a number).\nUse the same technique to select your Dropped Keys. Click the button at left,\nuse the steno emulator to select, and use the text display to confirm your choices.\nWARNING: When selecting Dropped Keys, be sure to select only those keys you\ntend to drop. If you select all the keys, you may get unexpected results when Eclipse\ntries to resolve dropped-key situations. (Dragged Keys are less critical in this regard.)\n893\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1077\nVISUALIZERS:\nD2 - Translation Options Untrans: Translation Magic\nE4aa - Speaker Prep\nE4b - By-Lines\nE4bb - Insert Missing By-Lines\nF4a - Conflicts Advice\nE3a - Translation Magic Customization\nC1 - Phonetics\n23.75 Using Visualizers\nUsing Visualizers\nThe Visualizer movies are brief audio/video presentations that demonstrate an\naspect of the Eclipse software.

Open the text file(s) you wish to use as a script.\n2. Add script commands to the file to divide it into sections. Add the\ntext S|NAME to each script command to give each section a unique\nname, such as S|SPORTS or S|WEATHER.\n3. On the Script List Manager, click Import. Each of the named sections\nyou created will appear in the list:\n86\n367\n1082 Eclipse Help\nAlternatively, you can click Add, which will add only the section the\ncursor is in. Also, Delete will delete the current section, and Clear All will\nclear the entire list.\nHowever you populate the list, you can go through it in order. Doubleclick\nthe first story in the list. That file will become active, and the cursor will\nbe on the first line below the script command.

This dialog control the\nappearance of the watermark.\nEnter the message you want to appear into the Text box. The default is\n\"DRAFT\", but this can be anything you like.\nThe Darkness (%) box controls how dark the watermark will be. The\ndefault is 10. A higher number will make the watermark darker, but this will\nmake the text of the transcript more difficult to read. A lower number will\nmake the watermark lighter.\nFont is the font that the watermark text will be rendered in. Type the\nname of the font you wish to use. The font name entered here must be an\nexact match with the name of a font you have installed on your computer.\n(Capitalization and spacing matter.)\nWidth and Height control the width and height of the watermark\nmessage.\nBoldness controls how bold the text is. A larger number will make the\nletters thicker.\n601\n602\n1084 Eclipse Help\nAngle is the angle at which the watermark is printed. A setting of 0\nwould make the text run horizontally; 90 will make the text run vertically;\n180 will make it upside down. The default setting of 45 produces a 45-degree\nangle. Any number between 0 and 360 may be entered.\nX-Position and Y-Position control the location on the page where the\nwatermarks begin printing.\nX-Offset and Y-Offset control how far each copy of the watermark\nmoves. The higher this number, the more distance there will be between\neach copy of the watermark.\nRepetitions is the number of times the watermark appears on each\npage.\nForce on all printouts, if checked, will force the watermark to print\neven on a non-draft printout, allowing you to print a complete copy of the\ndocument, including the text box, footers, etc., but still include a watermark.\n23.79 Window Menu\nWindow menu\nThe Window menu lists the filenames of every document open in the program.\nA checkmark appears to the left of the active document. To make another document\nactive, you can select it from the menu or type the number that appears to the left of\nthe documentâs name. (You can open the Window menu by pressing Alt then W.)\nYou can also use the Window menu to maximize, or âbring back,â a minimized file;\nopen the Window menu and type the number of the document you want.\nOther options on the Window menu relate to working with multiple documents,\nand arranging documents and other onscreen features:\nNew Window\nCreates a new window of the active document. Any changes made to the\ndocument in one window are reflected in the other(s). This feature allows you to view\none area of a document while you work on another area. You can have numerous\nwindows open for the same document. Each new window can be sized independently\nof the others, and each has its own title bar and control buttons (close, maximize,\nrestore, minimize). When new windows are created for a document, sequential\nnumbers are added to the end of the document title, indicating the order in which\neach was created. This command does not create a duplicate file, only multiple\nviewings of the same file.\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1085\nCascade\nArranges windows in an overlapping pattern, like this:\nIt resizes each open window to the same dimensions and then arranges the\nwindows in an offset stack so that the title bar and a portion of each windowâs left\nside remains visible. This option quickly organizes a cluttered desktop. To access any\nof the documents in the stack, click on any visible portion of the window.\nTile (Ctrl+Shift+F9)\nArranges windows in a non-overlapping fashion. Each window will be the same\nsize, and all available space in the master Eclipse window will be used. It resizes all\nopen windows to identical dimensions and arranges them top-to-bottom or side-byside\n(like tiles). If four or more are open, it will also do a grid arrangement. The tiles\nare sized such that the entire group will fill the main program window. This option is\nuseful when you need to work in more than one document at the same time (e.g.\ncopying information from one document to another). Selecting Tile will cycle through\nthe options.\nArrange Icons\nArranges all minimized windows at the bottom left of the main Eclipse window,\nlike this:\nFull Screen (F11)\nToggles in and out of full screen mode. When Full Screen is active, only the menu\nand document tabs can be seen. This format is useful for CART.\nSplit\n1086 Eclipse Help\nSplits the current window, allowing you to view it in two places at once. This is\nuseful if you are doing realtime with a live scopist; each of you can see a different\npart of the file.\nWhen you select this command, the split bar becomes active. Drag it to the point\nin the window where you want the document to split. Each side of the split bar can\nthen be viewed independently. (However, you can only work in one pane at a time.)\nThis can also be done by clicking and dragging the small rectangle that appears\nabove the vertical scroll bar:\nTo return to normal view, click and drag the split bar to the edge of the window.\nNOTE: The Split Window item on the Realtime tab of User Settings will\nautomatically split the window to a specified percentage each time you begin a\nrealtime job.\nSwitch Panes (Ctrl+Tab)\nIf you have more than one file open in Eclipse, this command will switch the\nfocus to the next file. You may use it repeatedly to cycle through all files.\nSwitch Utilities\nSwitches the focus to the next available utility window, such as the Realtime\nStatistics dialog.\nThis command is mostly for use in macros .\nView\nAllows you to make certain display elements visible or invisible.

The Zoom in (Ctrl+Shift+F7) and Zoom\nout (Ctrl+Shift+F8) functions are on the Window menu, and are buttons on the\nSmall edit tools toolbar.\nBoth buttons use a magnifying glass icon; the difference is that zoom in has a\nplus sign (+) on it and zoom out has a minus sign. The zoom-in magnifies the display\nto show the document in greater detail. The zoom-out reduces the display to show\nmore of the document in the available display area.\n998\n951\n122\n945\n142\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1089\nYou can also set how you want the file opened by defaultâdo you always want it\nto open at 100% of its size? 50%?

Use the Create New User button to do this.\nYou want to create an entirely different user, because you want each of your\nclients to have their own Edit Dictionary. The Main dictionary slot in a scopist's user is\nreferred to as the Edit Dictionary. Since the edit-only version of Eclipse cannot\ntranslate , the Main dictionary is a place to store Main globals for your client.\nAs you scope, you will make Main dictionary globals on the reporter's behalf. You\nmay then send the Edit dictionary to the reporter; they will have the option to accept\nor reject any Main globals you have made for them. The Edit Dictionary does not have\nto be sent to the reporter after each job; you may accumulate globals over several\njobs, and then share all of them at once.\n108\n108\n243 328\n1090 Eclipse Help\nWhen the reporter receives the Edit dictionary, they can use any of the block\noperations to merge the Edit dictionary with their Main dictionary. An easy way to\naccomplish this is to open the Edit dictionary, delete any unwanted entries, and\nthen use block read (Alt+R) to merge the entire dictionary.\nJob Dictionaries and Conflicts\nIf the reporter uses conflicts and works with a scopist, they must use the Job\ndictionary to convey them.\nIn addition to storing job-related dictionary entries, the Job dictionary is also\nused as a means of conveyance for conflicts. If set up correctly, the reporter's\nconflicts will benefit from conflict choices made by the scopist. To do this:\n1. Before doing the translation, the reporter must check Make Edit Station Info\non the User settings/Translate tab. When this option is marked, Eclipse\ninserts additional information into the job dictionary that allows scopists to\nreselect conflicts. This will allow your conflict dictionary entries to benefit from\nthe scopist's conflict selections. See the page on working with a scopist for more\ndetail.\n2. When sending the job to the scopist, also send the job dictionary.\n3. The scopist will scope the file, and will make conflict selections.\n4. The scopist will send the job dictionary back to the reporter.\n5. The reporter will look in the Job dictionary for any entries that contain conflict AI\ndata. (Quick way: click the AI column in the dictionary display to sort\nentries by AI data.)\n6. The reporter will transfer any such entries into Main dictionary. (Quick way:\nBlock Write (Alt+W) .\n7. The conflict AI data from the scopist will merge with the existing conflict AI data\nin the reporter's Main dictionary.\nFor more details, see the document Eclipse - Reporter & Scopist Dictionary\nManagement.pdf in the Eclipse Documentation folder.\nTracking Changes\nIn the Color Selections area of the Display tab , one of the choices is\nScopist Text Added on the Edit Station. Any text added by the scopist will appear\nin this color. If you have additional editors working using Shared Editing, you can set\na color for each using the 8 user-definable text types at the end of the Color\nselections list.\n392\n1035\n392\n169\n675\n141\n393\n31\n125 122\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1091\nIf you are scoping for someone else, but using the full translation version of the\nsoftware as opposed to the edit-only version, check Edit Station on the Edit tab .\nThis will make your system behave like an edit station, meaning that your client will\nbe able to see your changes.\nShared Editing with Connection Magic\nThe simplest way to share an editing session is by using Connection Magic. As\nlong as you have an internet connection, or a LAN (Local Area Network), you can set\nup an editing session that can be joined by any number of other users/scopists. For\ndetails on setting up and using Connection Magic, see the Connection Magic help\npage . Details on using Connection Magic on a LAN are in the Reference\nsection .\nDuring a shared editing session, anytime a paragraph no longer matches the\nreporter version of the document, it must be reconciled with the reporter, undoing any\nfurther changes that the scopist makes to the paragraphs. When that happens,\nEclipse draws the paragraph with a red background to warn the scopist not to edit\nanything in that paragraph until the reconciliation completes.\nDon't edit in paragraphs marked red for reconciliation. Wait until reconciliation has been\ncompleted before you edit this paragraph.\nDivision Intervals\nThe Division Interval field is a job-sharing feature. You control it using a spin\ncontrol on the User settings/Realtime tab . The number in this field corresponds\nto a time interval in minutes. Each time this interval passes, Eclipse creates a file\nusing the original job name and the time appended. The Division interval will use\nexact times (such as 9:17, 9:32, 9:47) at the intervals you choose. If you want the\nintervals to be at even fractions of an hour, such as 9:00, 9:15, 9:30 and 9:45, (even\nif you started the job at 9:08), set the Division interval to a negative number, such as\n-15. It will then use a division interval of 15 minutes, but will break the divisions on\neven fractions of an hour. If you want divisions at 9:08, 9:23, 9:38, etc., use 15\ninstead of -15.\n306\n532\n723\n487\n1092 Eclipse Help\nThe job name needs to end with an underscore. For example, if the job is called\nSmith_.ecl, the blocks might be called Smith_0900, Smith_0915, Smith_0930, etc.\n(Note: The reporter should include an underscore in the file name to enable the\nincremental files to sync with the realtime .wav file.) The last file, however, will have\nthe exact time the translation was stopped, for example, Smith_0952.\nThe reporter will need to set the DIVISION= path in the File locations section of\nthe Programming tab. The person scoping the incremental files will need to set the\nJobs path to the Reporter's network path. For audio sync, the scopist will need to set\nthe WAV= or WAVPLAY= path in the File locations section of the Programming tab.\n(For details see File Locations .) Scopists can then open and edit a divided file.\nEdited divisions can be recombined into a single file using the Read command.\nNote that this feature can extend filenames beyond eight characters, so make\nsure that your network can handle long filenames, or else use a main jobname with\nfour letters or fewer. (Older Novell networks, for example, may not support long\nfilenames.)\nEclipse will make a copy of the WAV file to the DIVISION folder after the division\ninterval expires. Subsequently, at each division, Eclipse will update that WAV file by\nappending the new data to the end of it.\nIt will also expire during a pause and write out a division at the appropriate time\neven if you aren't writing at that exact moment.\nForce Division\nWhile the division interval is normally set to a number of minutes, you can also\nbreak off a section immediately using Tools/Realtime/Force division. This will\ncause the division interval to split and write out, and a new one will start\nimmediately.\nYou can use this not only with regular intervals, but you can also use manual\nintervals entirely by setting the interval time to an arbitrarily large number such as\n99999 minutes, and then only using the \"Force division\" function to break off\ndivisions.\nDivOverlap setting in your user settings file\nIn the user settings file (your .ini file), there is a line that reads \"DivOverlap=2\"\nwhich indicates that there will be 2 paragraphs of overlap in the division interval\nsegments. You can change that to a different number by editing the settings (.ini) file\nmanually, using notepad or a similar text editor. If this number is changed to 0, the\noverlap will be eliminated entirely except for a single word, and the (continuing)\nmessage will be removed.\nVISUALIZERS:\nvH5_Scopist_Dictionary.mp4\nvH5a_Merge_Scopist_Dictionary.mp4\nvD3a_StenoLink.mp4\n839\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1093\nvD3a_StenoLink_Setup.mp4\nvD5_Remote_Scoping.mp4\nvD6_Shared_Editing.mp4\nvD6_Shared_Editing Tips.mp4\nvD6d_Connection_Magic_Users_Dialogue.mp4\n23.81 Working with Blanks\nWorking With BLANKS\nRELATES TO: Working With Block Files , Add\nBlank .\nBlanks (also known as blank fields, scan fields, or just fields) are used in the\ncreation of block files .\nWhen creating a block file, whenever you come to a place in the block file where\nthe information may vary -- such as the name of the deponent -- insert a blank at\nthat point.\nThen, after you read (Alt+R) the block file into a transcript, you can fill in\nthe blank with the information for that transcript.\nTips On Using Blanks\nÂ· Space around a blank the same way you would space around the text that goes in\nit. Any punctuation goes immediately before/after the field; otherwise it is\npreceeded and followed by a space. For example:\n548\n551\n548\n551\n392\n561\n1094 Eclipse Help\nÂ· Only use fields for information that can change.

A block file can be a lengthy title page, a brief parenthetical\nsuch as \"Whereupon a brief recess was taken\", or anything in between.\nBlock files are also called autoincludes.\nCreating A Block File\nTo create a new block file, start by creating a blank text file .\nThen, type the text you want to appear into the file, and use standard editing\ncommands to get the page to look the way you want it to. In particular, you will need\nto be able to work with paragraph styles .\nMost block files contain some information that will vary: the deponent's name,\nthe date, the exhibit number, etc. Insert a blank field into the block file each\ntime you have a piece of information that may vary.\nInserting A Block File\n850\n549 551\n392 962\n694\n1036\n445\n551\n1096 Eclipse Help\nOnce you have created a block file, you can insert it into a transcript several\ndifferent ways:\nÂ· A dictionary entry with the syntax {<FILENAME} will insert the file at that point.\nÂ· In editing, a Block Read (Alt+R) command will insert the file you select at the\ncursor location.\nÂ· On the Translate Notes dialog, if you choose an Initial Block or Final Block, the\nfile you choose will be automatically inserted at the beginning or end of the\ntranscript.\nLocation of Block Files\nTo work properly, block files must be stored in your Blocks folder.

Most of the functionality is\nthe same as Eclipse; the help screens on specific topics will be applicable.\n(Note: if you have not purchased AccuCap, you will still have access to a Student\nVersion of the program. It will connect to an encoder; however a \"student version\"\nmessage will appear every few lines. This does, however, allow you to enroll in a\ncaptioning course, if you are interesting in learning how to do it.)\nHere is a brief overview of captioning:\nSet Up A Captioning User\n392\n275\n108\n483\n519\n675 1038\n1055\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1097\nFirst, create a new user for yourself , and then import the settings file\ncalled ACCUCAP.SET. This file is located in the Eclipse folder; in a default installation,\nthis would be C:\\Program Files\\Advantage Software\\Eclipse. Importing this SET file\nwill give you a default captioning setup.\nSet Up Realtime Output Options\nImporting ACCUCAP.SET will give you a default setup, but you will have\ncustomize some aspects of the Realtime tab to your own situation. In particular,\nget to know the Output Formats dialog, especially the captioning-specific\noptions .\nHardware\nYou will need to acquire a \"56K, external, serial modem\" if you want to dial into\nan encoder at a television station. Encoders operate at very slow speeds compared to\nmodern internet modems. If you attempt to connect to a captioning encoder with a\nmodern internet modem, you will probably get bad results. Be sure to ask for this\ntype of modem. Advantage Software tech support can give you a more detailed list of\nrecommended modem brands.\nAlso, you will need a COM port to plug the modem into. If you don't have enough\nCOM ports, see realtime hardware for information on how to produce another\none.\nYou may also connect to an encoder via direct cable. The setup for this is very\nsimilar to setting up CIC; see the page on CIC output options .\nOnce all hardware and settings are in place, the Phone Book allows you to\ndial into an encoder.\nDictionaries\nCaptioners must be proficient at working with multiple dictionaries . They\nwill generally build small dictionaries specific to the type of show they are covering,\nsuch as a dictionary of world leaders for use in news programs, and a dictionary of\ncaptioning entries. This allows you to pick-and-choose extra dictionaries for each job.\nFor example, if you cover sports news, you may want to keep \"general baseball terms\"\nseparate from \"general hockey terms\"; by doing so, you can use one without the other\nif need be (such as for a hockey game, in which baseball terms are unlikely to be\nused).\nFurthermore, captioners must be skilled with the glue alphabet , as they will\nfrequently have to write words that are not in their dictionary, such as unexpected\nnames.\nOther dictionary entries that captioners will need:\nSyntax What It Does Suggested Location\n109 103\n487\n520\n523\n484\n522\n1038\n675\n960\n1098 Eclipse Help\n{BLANK} Blanks the captioning display. separate dictionary of captioning\nterms\n{FLUSH}\nForces all buffered text to the\noutput, overriding Flush Word\nDelay .\nseparate dictionary of captioning\nterms\n{^} Delete space.

It\nis common to use STKPWHR and\n-FRPBLGTS for these items.\nBlock, Passthrough, and other Modes\nYou must manually change the mode of the encoder between Block and\nPassthrough. Block means that only your captions will be accepted: Passthrough\nmeans that other caption sources will take precedence. In practice, you will switch to\nPassthrough during commercials, and then Block when the show is back on.\nThe following keystrokes invoke these, and other useful modes:\nÂ· F6 - Block.\nÂ· F2 - Passthrough.\nÂ· F3 - Blank and Pass.\nÂ· F4 - Suspend toggle. (When in suspend mode, nothing you write will be sent. Use\nthis mode to quickly write and global entries during a break.)\nSee the AccuCap addendum in the Eclipse Documentation for more details.\nScripting\nWith any text file open, the Send Script Line (F12) command will send a\nline to the encoder. This allows you to use existing files as scripts.\nTo prepare an open text file for use as a script, you can use the Format\nmenu/Document utility feature Format script. It will format the entire document\nyou are in. If you mark a block before executing this function, it will only format the\ntext in the block. It breaks up all of the text into new paragraphs at every terminal\npunctuation mark, which is every location in the document where any of the following\nsymbols [.?!:] is followed by two spaces.\nIf the current script paragraph doesn't have steno associated with each line,\nthen in order to timecode each line in the realtime document, the send script line\ncommand MUST create a new paragraph for each line. This is necessary to eliminates\nduplicate timecodes\nScript lines that are sent to the encoder are also added to the realtime\ntranslation. If your job is a combination of scripted and live-written material, the\ntranscript file will reflect both.\nScripts can also accept commands. Insert a Script Command , and type the\nfollowing codes into the command to produce the following actions:\nÂ· B - blank\nÂ· M|P - switch to pop-on captions (typical for credit files)\nÂ· M|R - switch to roll-up captions\nÂ· P|X,Y - change vertical position. X is the starting row, Y is the number of rows.\nÂ· S|NAME - assigns a name to this section. For use with the Script List Manager .\nYou can also use the Script List Manager to handle scripting.\n326\n31\n694 1055\n367\n1052\n1052\n1100 Eclipse Help\nExporting your files\nThe File/Export function includes three options for captioners. At times, you\nwill need to export the text of a completed captioning session. For example, there is a\nlegal requirement to provide captions on any Internet-distributed video if the original\nbroadcast version of the video had captions on it.\nÂ· SCC captioning - Files in this format can be imported by a number of off-line\ncaptioning software products such as the CPC software. Some encoding\nhardware can directly import .scc files and encode the captions stored in them\ndirectly to video without using any additional software. SCC files contain\ntimecodes and captions, so you can do a live captioning job, go back and clean\nup the text, and then provide a .scc file to the station so that they can burn\nthe edited captions on the stored copy of the program for later distribution.\nÂ· SMPTE-TT is a specialized type of XML output that is used for web-based offline\ncaptioning. Like the .scc output, this is being used by many companies in\norder to comply with the regulations for providing off-line versions of on-line\ncaptions when videos are published on the web.\nÂ· SAMI files are used for post-production captioning on Windows Media player\nfiles.\nVISUALIZERS:\nL4 - AccuCAP\nL4a - YouTube\n23.84 Working with Conversions\nWorking With\nCONVERSIONS\nRELATES TO: Import , Export , Convert .\nEclipse allows you to convert note files , text files , and dictionaries to\na variety of useful, non-Eclipse formats.\nConverting files can be done via one of three commands in Eclipse:\nÂ· Import : Import an external file into an Eclipse file.\nÂ· Export : Export an Eclipse file to a non-Eclipse format.\nÂ· Convert : Allows you to do a complete conversion to or from another file format,\nvia a series of prompts.\nTypes of Conversions\nGenerally speaking, you have the ability to convert to and from the following file\ntypes:\n990 966 948\n224 694 672\n990\n966\n948\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1101\nÂ· RTF/CRE. RTF for short, this format is a means of conveying files to/from other CAT\nsystems.\nÂ· ASCII. A generic text file that can be viewed/edited in any text editor program. Can\nbe used for conversions, but RTF/CRE is superior. Uses the TXT extension. (Note: If\nyou simply want to create an ASCII file of a transcript, use the Output To ASCII\noption.\nÂ· Eclipse Version 8. Files from Eclipse Version 8 (DOS) and Eclipse are not\ninterchangeable (even though some use the same extensions ). These files need\nto be converted into Eclipse files.\nÂ· SDF or SDIF. An older protocol for file conversions. Use only if you are converting\nto/from a system that supports only this method.\nÂ· Other CAT systems. The Convert menu item allows you to work directly with\nnative file formats of other CAT systems.\nÂ· Other file formats. You can create files that serve other useful purposes, such as\ninstalling a dictionary onto a Stentura 8000 writer, or creating an HTML file of a\ntranscript that can be viewed in a web browser.\nFor more details on each of these file types, see the individual pages on\nImport , Export , and Convert .\nConverting To/From Other CAT Systems\nFor best results, follow these rules when converting files to/from other CAT\nsystems:\nÂ· Use RTF/CRE whenever possible. The RTF standard was designed with inter-CAT\nsystem conversions in mind. Each CAT system has the ability to export to, and\nimport from, RTF. If you want to receive a file from another CAT system, export the\nfile to RTF from that system. Then, import from RTF to Eclipse. Likewise, when\nexporting to a different CAT system, it is best to export to RTF, and then use that\nsystem to import from RTF.\nÂ· Set your margins to match. When importing from RTF, Eclipse will use your\nsettings on the Document tab and Paragraphs tab , rather than the margin\nsettings called for in the RTF file itself. If it is crucial that the margins not change,\nset your Eclipse margins to match what the other CAT system used.\nÂ· Clean up or remake title pages. Title pages don't convert well, because different\nCAT systems have very different ways of handling them. You will likely have to fix\nthem up, or remake them.\nVISUALIZERS:\nJ4 - Convert Files\nH4 - Dictionary Export\nH9 - Passport Dictionary Conversion\nP6c - Passport Touch Dictionary\nI6 - Bridge Mobile Proofreading\nD1a - Extended Steno Dictionary Conversion\n622\n971\n948\n990 966 948\n434 447\n1102 Eclipse Help\n23.85 Working with Dictionaries\nWorking With...\nDICTIONARIES\nRELATES TO: Build Dictionary , Dictionary\nentry syntax , Dictionaries dialog , Open\nDictionary , AutoMagic in a Dictionary ,\nDictionary Filter , Working With Multiple\nDictionaries .\nA dictionary is a list of steno outlines and their equivalent definitions. Dictionaries\nmay also contain text globals .\nWhen you translate a job or do realtime , the steno translates against your\nmain dictionary, and one or more additional dictionaries.\nTo enter a dictionary, press F9 and then select the dictionary you want to work\nwith. If you have an Eclipse text file open when you press F9, you will select the\ndesired dictionary from the Dictionaries dialog . If not, you will select from the\nstandard file dialog . You can also create a new dictionary from the file dialog by\nentering the name you wish to give the new dictionary.\nYour dictionary entries must follow a certain syntax . There are codes for\nQ/A/speakers, punctuation, autoinclude entries, and other useful commands.\nOnce inside a dictionary, you can perform any of the following actions:\nÂ· Move around, using the applicable basic cursor movements .

It prefers left-side phonetics, so when you hit\n\"L\" you will get the entries starting with HR, not the entries starting with the rightside\n-L key. There are a relatively small number of right-side-only entries in a\ndictionary, and they all appear at the top, so it makes sense to skip those.\nIf you have sorted the dictionary by text, you will jump to the first entry that\nstarts with that text. It is case-sensitive, and you can type multiple letters to jump to\nthe first entries that start with those letters as a sequence. After a one-second pause,\nany new letter hit will be considered the start of a new word.\nNote that this will not work if you have hyperkeys turned on.\nMoving around using steno equivalents\nYou can type the first several letters of a steno stroke in order to jump directly to\nthe dictionary entry you're interested in without having to use the search or go to\nfunctions.\nThis feature does allow phonetic equivalents. As long as you type the letters with\nless than a second delay, it will assume that you intend them as a sequence. For\nexample, if you hit \"N\" it might jump to \"TPH- = in\", then hitting \"I\" will jump to\n\"TPHEU = any\", then hitting \"N\" again will jump to \"TPHEUPB = anyone\".\nNote that this will not work if you have hyperkeys turned on.\nVISUALIZERS:\nvM5_Auto-Magic_Dictionary.mp4\nvH1 Analyze Documents.mp4\nvH1_Build_Dictionary.mp4\nvH1_Dictionary_Selection.mp4\nvH1a_Change_Translating_Dictionaries.mp4\nvH6_Dictionary_Optimize.mp4\nVH3_Text-Sorted_Dictionaries.mp4\nvH6a_Arranging_Dictionary_Columns.mp4\nvH3_Dictionary_Additions_Spellcheck.mp4\nvH3_Dictionary_Edit.mp4\nvH3_Dictionary_Properties_Comments.mp4\nvH2_Dictionary_Searches.mp4\nvH2_Go_to_Steno.mp4\nvH2_Starts_Ends_Exact.mp4\n1104 Eclipse Help\nvH2_Keys_v_Strokes.mp4\nvH2_Dictionary_Find_Replace.mp4\nvH2a_Dictionary_Advanced.mp4\nvH2b_Selecting_Dictionary_Entries.mp4\nvH2b_Move_Dictionary_Entries.mp4\nvH2b_Unmerge_Dictionaries.mp4\nvH4_Dictionary_Export.mp4\nvH5_Scopist_Dictionary.mp4\nvH5a_Merge_Scopist_Dictionary.mp4\nvH7_Dictionary_Statistics.mp4\nvH8_Dictionary_Printout.mp4\nvH9_Passport_Dictionary.mp4\nvP6c_Passport_Touch Dictionary.mp4\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1105\n23.86 Working with Eclipse Steno Link\nWorking With ECLIPSE\nSTENOLINK\nRELATES TO: Output Formats , Working With\na Scopist , Working With Realtime\nOutput , Global , Connection Magic ,\nWorking With Realtime , Working With\nDictionaries .\nEclipse StenoLink allows a scopist to edit a realtime transcript remotely, via a\ncable connection or via the Internet.\nWhen using Eclipse StenoLink, two separate translations are performed. The\nsteno is translated against the reporter's dictionary on the reporter's computer, as\nalways. The steno is then sent to the scopist's computer, where it is translated a\nsecond time. This requires the scopist to have the reporter's main dictionary, as well\nas any other dictionaries being used in this job.\nAny globals made by a scopist using Eclipse StenoLink will be sent back to\nthe reporter's computer, as if they had been performed there. So not only can the\nscopist edit a job in realtime, the scopist can also improve the reporter's translation\nrate, and build the reporter's dictionaries.\nScopist Setup\n1. The scopist must have up-to-the-minute copies of all dictionaries that the\nreporter intends to use in the job.\n2. The scopist must go to the dictionaries dialog , and assign these\ndictionaries to the same slots that the reporter has them in.\n3. On the Input tab , the scopist must set their writer type to Eclipse\nStenoLink.\n4. On the Input tab , the scopist must set Realtime From to COM port if\nthey are connected to the reporter via cable, or TCP/IP if they are connecting via\nthe Internet.\nReporter Setup\n1.

The reporter must set up an Output Format . Select \"Eclipse StenoLink\" from\nthe Output Format drop-down list, and set Comm Device to either COM Port (for\na cable connection) or TCP/IP (for a connection via Internet).\nConnecting Via Cable\nIf the reporter and scopist computers are to be connected via COM port, the\nsetup is the same as it would be for realtime output .\nIn the Output Format , the reporter selects COM Port from the Comm Device\ndrop-down list, and then clicks the Setup button to open the COMM Setup dialog.\nThe reporter then sets Baud Rate to 9600, and sets Port to the COM port number\nthat is being used for output.\nThe scopist goes to the Input tab , sets Realtime From to COM Port, and\nthen clicks the Setup button to the right. This opens the COMM Setup dialog,\nwhere the scopist sets Baud Rate to 9600, and sets COM port to the number of the\nCOM port on their computer that the cable is connected to. If you're not sure what\nyour COM port number is, here's how to determine it .\nConnecting Via Internet\nAfter performing all the steps in Reporter Setup above, the reporter sets the\nComm Device in Output Formats to TCP/IP, and then clicks the Setup button at\nright. The dialog will ask you to add an Internet Address, and then a Port number.\nTo determine your Internet address:\n1. In Windows, Click Start, and then click Run.\n2. Type command and then press Enter. A DOS prompt will appear.\n3. At the DOS prompt, type ipconfig and then press Enter.\n4. Several lines of information will appear. You are looking for the line \"IP\nAddress.\" It will look something like this:\n520\n519\n520\n947\n484\n226 227\n947\n484\n528\n520\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1107\n5. Make a note of your IP Address. In the above graphic, \"192.168.1.2\" is the IP\nAddress. This is the number you will enter into Eclipse. NOTE: Depending on\nyour Internet service provider, this number may change from day to day. Be\nsure to check it each time before doing Eclipse StenoLink via TCP/IP.\n6. Type exit and then press Enter to leave the DOS prompt.\nGo back to Output Formats , click Setup, and enter this number into the\ndialog that appears:\nYou will then be asked to enter a port number. If you're not sure, enter 21. If you\nare unable to connect to the scopist, ask your network administrator or Internet\nservice provider to suggest a port number.\n7. Eclipse prompts for an optional username and password. (Some direct TCP-IP\nconnection systems such as Speche require typing a username and a password.)\nIn addition to automating the username/password sending when connecting, if\nthe connection is dropped, it will re-transmit the username and password when\nreconnecting. If you don't need a username and password, just leave it blank\nand hit OK.\nOnce all this is ready, the reporter must then tell the scopist their IP address and\nport number. The scopist goes to the Input tab , clicks the Setup button to the\nright of Realtime From , and enters the same information.\nStarting The Realtime Job\n520\n226\n227\n1108 Eclipse Help\nOnce all the above settings are in place, the reporter and the scopist each starts\na realtime job, via Translate Notes or the Instant Realtime button.\nNOTE: The Eclipse Edit Station (a version of the software for scopists) can\nperform translations if their writer type is set to Eclipse StenoLink. Otherwise, the Edit\nStation still cannot translate notes or do realtime .\nAudio recording sent through StenoLink connection\nWARNING: If you are going to transmit audio through StenoLink, it is highly\nrecommended that you use a heavily compressed audio format such as GSM. PCM files\nare likely to be much too large to stream effectively.\nHere's how this works. Instead of having the audio be on-demand through the IP\nconnection, the reporter's computer sends ALL of the audio as it's recorded. The\nScopist's computer then ends up with a complete WAV file being updated every few\nseconds as the reporter's computer records it. Since it's a local copy of the file, the\nscopist's WAV file is even available after the scopist disconnects.\nCurrently, there's no handshaking or re-sending of lost data, so if the scopist\ncomputer misses something, it's missed. You can always get a complete copy of the\nWAV file from the reporter later. If the reporter starts recording for two minutes and\nthen the scopist hooks up, they will have missed two minutes of audio (and steno\nstrokes.)\nConnection Magic and StenoLink Sessions\nYou can also use Connection Magic as a communications device type with the\nStenoLink output format on the reporter's system when doing realtime. This allows\nyou to send realtime from a reporter to a scopist through the Internet session server.\nStart the realtime on the reporter's side first, filling in the information in the\nsession dialog as necessary. On the scopist's side, start a realtime job and you should\nget a list of available public sessions. If the reporter's session is not on the list, select\nthe \"[Join a session not listed]\" option and type the name instead.\nThis works almost identically to the way that StenoLink works across a raw TCPIP\nconnection except that it's much easier to get going. Also, globals are symmetrical.\nAny global that the scopist performs will show up on the reporter's computer, and any\nglobal that the reporter performs will show up on the scopist's computer.\nAs with StenoLink, it is recommended that you use a heavily compressed audio\nformat such as GSM. PCM files are likely to be much too large to stream effectively.\nVISUALIZERS:\nD3a - StenoLink\nD3a - StenoLink Setup\nvD5 - Remote Scoping\nvD6 - Shared Editing\n483 271 486\n269 483\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1109\nvD6a Shared Editing Tips\n23.87 Working with Fonts\nWorking With FONTS\nThere are many ways to change font styles in Eclipse. Be sure to use the method\nthat best reflects the change you wish to make.\nYou can change the font for the entire document, or for only a text selection. In\nboth cases, you will use the Font dialog (Ctrl+Shift+F).\nIf you just want to change the font to make it easier to read on the display, you\ncan go to the Display tab of User Settings and click the Editing Font button. This\nchange will affect the display only.\nTo change the font used for printing the transcript, go to the Document tab\nand click Main Font. This will change the transcript's primary font; if you print it, it\nwill be in the font you chose. Any bold faced, italicized, or underlined text will be\nchanged to the new font as well.\nIf you want to temporarily change fonts in a dictionary entry -- such as to\nitalicize the name of a newspaper -- there are a variety of font commands that can do\nthis. See the page on Dictionary Entry Syntax for a full list of font commands and\nhow they work.\nWhen editing a transcript, if you want to change some text to a different font,\nmark the text , and then use the Format Font command. Any change you make\nwill apply to the marked text only.\nFor minor font changes in a document, such as to bold-face, italicize, or\nsuperscript/subscript something, you can use the text attributes dialog.\nYou can also assign fonts to different paragraph types . For example, you\nmake your questions appears in bold face, and your answers in regular text. To do\nthis, go to the User settings/Paragraphs tab , select the paragraph format to work\nwith, click Advanced to go to the Advanced Paragraph Data dialog, and then click\nMain Font or Label Font. Choose a typestyle for the paragraph using the standard Font\ndialog. Click OK to accept the options and return to the Paragraph tab. Then click OK\nagain to save the format.\nYou can change the appearance of dictionaries and note files by right-clicking\nthe file, and selecting Font from the menu. You will be taken to the font dialog ,\nwhere you can choose the desired font, attributes, and size for the file type you are\nworking with. This change will affect all files of that type, within the current user.\nSetting the font for an entire document\nTo set the font for your document,\n122\n434\n958\n394 982\n1060\n445\n447\n450\n980\n1110 Eclipse Help\n1. Use the keyboard shortcut, go to User Settings (Alt+U).\n2. Click the Document tab. Select the Master Format or Current Document format\naccording to where you want to apply the setting.\n3. On the Document tab click the Main font button. The Font dialog will open. The\ncurrent font for the document is in the font field.\n4. Select the font you want from the scrollable list below the font field. (Courier\nNew is commonly used.)\nIcons to the left of a font name indicate the font type. For example, TT indicates a\nTrueType font.\nTo see what a specific font looks like, click on it. A sample of the font face will\nappear in the box labeled Sample. The sample field reflects the size and styles also\nselected with the font.\n5. Select the font size that you want used throughout the document (Courier New\n13 is common). Do not select any Font style other than âRegular,â unless you\nreally do want all the text in your transcripts underlined, italic, etc.\n6. Once you have selected the font and size, click the OK button. This will return\nyou to the Document tab, where you can again click the OK button to return to\nyour document.\nSetting the font for selected text\nTo set the font for a block of selected text:\n1. First block mark the text you want to format.\n2. Open the Font dialog (Ctrl+Shift+F). The current font for the document will\nshow in the font field.\n3. Select the font or font characteristics.\n4. Click OK to have your selections take effect. Click Cancel to disregard the\nselections and return to the document window.\nIf you put the cursor on the beginning of a word in a different font and start\ntyping, what you type will be in the same font as the word. If you place the cursor\nimmediately AFTER the word, it will be in the font that appears after the word.\nSelecting a Font Size\n394\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1111\nType size is the height of a font measured in points (72 points = one inch).\nBecause some letters, such as âf,â have parts that go above a midpoint (called\nascenders) and others, such as âg,â have parts that go below the line (called\ndescenders), height is measured from the bottom of a descender to the top of an\nascender (in other words, the height is greater than the height of a capital letter).\nText intended to be read on a printed page is typically 10 to 12 points. If you have\nselected a scalable font, such as TrueType or Adobe Type 1, you can enter a number\nfor the size even if it does not appear on the type size list. If the font is not scalable,\nyou must select one of the values on the type size list. To choose the font to use for\ndocuments, the best thing to do is to set the font in your User\nSettings/Document/Main font. This setting will cover 99.99% of your work.\nSubscripts and Superscripts\nIn any of the font dialogs, sub- and superscripts are indicated by the vertical\noffset field in the bottom left corner of the dialog. You can either type a number in the\nfield, or use the arrows to scroll the numbers up and down. Normal text will be set to\n0; superscripts are indicated by positive numbers and subscripts by negative\nnumbers. The measurement is in twips, which represents a twentieth of a point (72\npoints = 1 inch). For example, you can set a superscript of an 8 or 10 point font to\n100 and a subscript to â80. (Note that small fonts donât need to move down as far as\nthey need to move up to achieve a similar effect.\nFor example, the 2 in H2O has no offset, but is already 80 twips shorter that the\nH & O.\nIn H2O it has an offset of -80 twips; in H2O it has an offset of 100 twips.)\nSetting the character width\nAll fixed-space fonts in a document will conform to the width (in twips) specified\nby the character spacing setting in User Settings/Document. It defaults to 144 (1440\ntwips per inch / 144 = 10 characters per inch). To set the character spacing for a\ndocument, go to the User Settings/Document tab/Document settings drop-down\nmenu (the menu usually shows Page width by default). After selecting Character\nsettings, set the width that you want in the twips field on the right side of the dialog.\nCharacter spacing does not affect proportional fonts, so any stylistic proportional\nformatting in your documents will be unaffected.\nImportant noteâIf you use multiple fixed-space font sizes in your document,\nthey will all have the same pitch, regardless of their size.\nEvery character in fixed-space fonts will adhere to these measurements exactly.\nThis feature can actually compress letters closer together than the Windows\ndefault for that font, and can be used when increasing font size to keep letters\nequidistant.\nSetting font for a paragraph format\nTo set the font and typestyle for paragraph formats:\n1. Go to User Settings/Paragraphs tab, select the format you want to change,\nand then click the Advanced button.\n1112 Eclipse Help\n2. Click Text font button and choose a typestyle for the paragraph using the\nstandard Font dialog.\n3. Click OK to accept the options and return to the Paragraph tab. Then click OK\nagain to save the format.\nSetting fonts for special parts of paragraphs\nTo set the font for paragraph labels, speaker names, etc., you will need to edit\nthe paragraph format. The basic method for doing that is given below. When you edit\nthe paragraph format, the change takes effect for all paragraphs using that format,\nnot just the current paragraph. Note that if you are editing a document created with\nan earlier version of Eclipse, you might need to retranslate to have the change take\neffect on all paragraphs of that format.\nSetting fonts for individual paragraph labels\nTo change one instance of a paragraph label (perhaps for a particular speaker),\n1. Select the paragraph label either by moving the cursor to the first line of the\nparagraph and pressing Home twice, or by clicking the paragraph label.\n2. Open the font dialog (Ctrl+Shift+F).\n3. Select the font and/or font characteristics you want. Click OK.\nNote that the label will be changed for only the paragraph from which the\ncommand was issued.\nSetting font for one paragraph\nTo change the font for a paragraph, place the cursor anywhere in the paragraph\n(without marking a block), and then press Ctrl+Shift+F for the Font dialog. Select\nthe font you want, and then click OK. The change is applied to the entire paragraph,\nincluding the text that is before the cursor as well as what follows it.\nStriking out and underlining\nTo indicate text to be deleted, use the strikeout style. It put a line through the\ntext, similar to what you would do if you were editing on paper and crossed\nsomething out.\nThe underline places a single continuous line under the text.

By default,\nMisstrokes is always unchecked; the other two suggestion types will default to being\nchecked. The categories you have selected will reflect the suggestions you get. (Each\ncategory is explained below.)\nWhen you make a dictionary global that lends itself to suggestions, the\nAdditional entry suggestions dialog will appear. To accept suggestions:\nÂ· Click Accept All to add all suggestions to the dictionary.\nÂ· Click Cancel, or press Escape, to add no suggestions to the dictionary. (The\noriginal global will still be added.)\nÂ· To add some suggestions but not others, highlight the selections you wish to\nkeep, and then click OK or press Enter. The list of selections can be navigated\nusing the up arrow/down arrow keys; press the Spacebar to toggle a\nsuggestion on or off.\nAny suggestions you accept will be added to the dictionary into which the\noriginal global was made.\nSuggestion Types\nNormalize suggestions apply to steno outlines of two or more strokes.\nSometimes it is possible to write the same sounds that make up the entire outline, in\ndifferent locations. For example, if you global PET/TEUGS as \"petition\", you will\nreceive the suggestions PET/EUGS and PE/TEUGS. In the original global, the T sound\nis included in both the initial stroke and the second stroke (pet/tition); in each of the\nsuggestions, it is in one or the other (pet/ition and pe/tition).\n846\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1115\nIntegral prefixes/suffixes suggestions offer you versions of the word you had\ngloballed, with additional final-side keys added to produce different tenses: -G for ing,\n-D for ed, -S for s, etc. For example, if you global the steno SRAOU as \"view\", you\nwould be offered SRAOUD=viewed, SRAOUG=viewing, and SRAOUS=views.\nMisstrokes, as the name suggests, are possible misstrokes for the selected\nsteno. Be careful accepting misstroke suggestions, however: each piece of steno can\nhave dozens of possible misstrokes. Furthermore, if you are also using the other\nsuggestions, you'll get misstroke versions of those suggestions as well. If you\nindiscriminately accept misstroke suggestions, your dictionary can soon balloon to an\nunmanageable size. Be judicious when accepting misstrokes; accept only those that\nreflect your writing style.\nDepending on the nature of the steno outline, you may get suggestions from one\nor more categories. Some steno outlines will not have any suggestions.\nIf the suggestions dialog appears, and the list of suggestions is blank, that\nmeans the suggestions are in categories you have disabled.\nCustomization of Suggestions\nThe Programming tab of User Settings has two sub-categories relating to\nglobal suggestions: Integral Prefix and Suffix Steno Definitions and Normalization\nTable for Steno Definitions .

This allows you to keep your hands in one place, and saves you having\nto reach for Ctrl/Alt keys, thus speeding your editing time.\nA list of the default Hyperkeys is in the Reference Guide.\nOnly repetitive editing tasks have hyperkeys. There are no hyperkeys for nonrepetitive\ntasks like Open Text , User Settings , or Close . Just use the\nstandard keys for those actions. (Standard keystrokes will always work, even if you\nhave hyperkeys turned on.)\nWhen using hyperkeys, you will need to suspend them if you want to type text.\nThis is accomplished with the Type Text command (hyperkey N). When you need\nto type something, press the N key; that will temporarily suspend hyperkeys and\nallow you to type text as normal. When you are finished typing text, press Enter, and\nthe hyperkeys will be reactivated.\nThe hyperkeys command (Alt+Z), toggles them on and off. You can tell if\nhyperkeys are on by any of the following methods:\nÂ· The text HYP will appear in the status bar at bottom right.\nÂ· The Hyperkeys button on the toolbar will appear pushed-in.\nÂ· The cursor width will change. By default, a wide cursor means hyperkeys are on,\nand a thin cursor means they are off. This can be redefined with the Hyperkey\nWidth item on the Display tab of User Settings .\nThere are several places in the program where you can see a list of hyperkeys:\nÂ· If hyperkeys are turned on, the menu hints will show you the hyperkeys for each\naction.\nÂ· The AutoMagic infobar will show you the hyperkeys for each suggestion on the list.\nÂ· Each page in the help system gives the default hyperkey for that action, if there is\none.\nÂ· The Documentation folder (Support menu/Documentation) contains a file\ncalled \"Eclipse Hyperkeys.pdf\", which is a printable chart of hyperkeys.\nÂ· You can print a list of all key assignments , including hyperkeys, from the\nKeyboard dialog .\nTyping Over\nIf you use the Type Text command (hyperkey N) to suspend hyperkeys,\nyou can also use it to replace an existing word with the new word. To do this:\n1. With the cursor at the beginning of the word you want to replace, press hyperkey\nN.\n2. Type the new word.\n3. Press Enter. This is the normal step to return to hyperkey mode.\n4. Press Enter a second time. This will remove the old word.\nWhenever you do this, an entry is made in the typeover tracking list.\nVISUALIZERS:\n777\n86 99 945\n317\n315\n1058\n129 122\n31\n1010\n1008\n317\n884\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1117\nA7 - Hyperkeys\nM3 - AutoMagic Display\nM3a Auto-Magic Numbered Choices\n23.90 Working with Indexing\nWorking With INDEXING\nIndexing Overview\nTo create an automatic index in Eclipse, you must:\nÂ· Insert an index line into the transcript for each item you want to appear in the\nindex.\nÂ· Have correct paragraph margin settings in place.\nÂ· Generate the index.\nInsert An Index Line\nYou can insert an index line into a transcript via an index line print\ncommand , or by using the Insert Index Item dialog.\nWhichever method you use, you will be creating an index line that contains the\nfollowing five components:\nÂ· Index Name. Determines which index this entry goes into. For example, you could\nhave an index of EXHIBITS and an index of WITNESSES.\nÂ· Index Item. The text that appears in the index. Usually this is an exhibit number,\nor the name of a witness or attorney.\nÂ· Paragraph Style. The paragraph style that is being used to control the margins and\nappearance of the index. See the next section for details.\nÂ· Body Text or Description. Optional. This item is most often used when you are\nindexing both the exhibit number and a description. The exhibit number would be\nthe Index Item, and the description would be the Body Text.\nÂ· Location Format. A code that indicates whether you are placing a page, line, or\nvolume number, and where it is being placed:\no {P} places a page number.\no {L} places a line number.\no {V} places a volume number.\no {TR:X} means to place this item at tab stop X. For example, {TR:1} would be tab\nstop #1, the left-most tab stop in the Paragraph Style you are using. (Note: you\ncan also use {TL:X} or {TC:X}, to left-align or center-align this item.)\nA location format entry consists of a tab stop item, followed by what is being\nplaced there. Here are some examples:\nÂ· {TR:1}{P} will place the page number at tab stop 1.\n366 568\n1118 Eclipse Help\nÂ· {TR:3}{P} will place the page number at tab stop 3.\nÂ· {TR:1}{P}{TR:2}{L} will place the page number at tab stop 1, and the line\nnumber at tab stop 2.\nÂ· {TR:1}{V}{TR:2}{P} will place the volume number at tab stop 1, and the page\nnumber at tab stop 2.\nÂ· {TR:1}Pg. {P} will place the text \"Pg. \" followed by the page number, at tab stop\n1.\nThe five components of an index line are separated by pipes:\nThe pipe symbol | is a vertical line. On most keyboards, you type Shift+\\\n(Shift+backslash) to produce it.\nThe In: text is inserted automatically by Eclipse. (This indicates an index line, as\nopposed to some other print command .)\nNote that an index line can wrap if it is longer than one line. This is normal.\nIf you are not using one component of the index line, such as the Body Text,\ninclude an extra pipe symbol at that point:\nThis is the same index line as above, with only the Body Text (\"a letter dated May\n16, 2005\") omitted. There is an extra pipe at that point to indicate that there is no\nBody Text.\nSet Up Paragraph Data\nThe paragraph margins do not have to be set up each time you generate an\nindex. After setting them up the first time in the Master Format, they will remain in\nyour user settings, and will be used in future jobs.\nAs mentioned in the previous section, one of the components of an index line is\nthe Paragraph Style. The paragraph style is used to control the appearance of the\nindex. (It is common to use the Index1 paragraph style for this purpose;\nalternatively, you can create a new paragraph style .)\nThe paragraph margin settings have special meanings for indexing paragraphs:\nÂ· Indentation dictates where the Index Item begins. A setting of 0 will start the\nIndex Item at the far left. If you want the index item indented, set this to a\nnumber above 0 (such as 5).\nÂ· Text Column dictates where the Description begins. This needs to be set high\nenough to leave room for the entire Index Item. A setting of 15 is typical; if\nthe Index Item is not indented, this leaves room for up to 14 characters in the\nIndex Item, and one space before the Body Text begins. If you are not using a\nBody Text, this setting is less important.\n362\n448\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1119\nÂ· Left Margin dictates where the second and subsequent lines of the Body Text\nbegin. Typically, you would set this to the same number you set Text Column\nto. Again, since this setting only affects Body Text, it is less important if you\nare not using Body Text.\nÂ· Right Margin dictates where the Body Text wraps to the next line. The number\nfor this setting needs to lower than the number of the first tab by at least 4, to\nleave room for the first page number.\nÂ· Tab Stops are chosen in Tab Stops dialog . You need to select one tab stop\nfor each column you are using for page/line/volumne numbers. If you are\nindexing only page numbers, you need only one tab stop. For a multicolumnar\nsetup (such as for page and line number, or for \"marked\" and\n\"identified\" page numbers), you will need at least two tab stops.\nWhen setting up indexing for the first time, any changes you make to paragraph\nmargin settings need to be made in both the Master Format and the Current\nDocument .\nAgain, once your paragraph margins are set up correctly in the Master Format,\nnew documents will be created with these correct settings in place. You do not need\nto set them each time, or edit them at all unless you make a change to the\nappearance of your indexes.\nGenerate The Index\nOnce the index lines are in place, an index can be generated via Generate\nIndex . You will be asked the following questions:\nÂ· Which volume numbers do you want to index?\nÂ· Do you want to create an index for just the active document, or do you want to\ncreate a master index of multiple jobs?\nYou will then be given an opportunity to preview the index, and to change the\nnumber of extra pages that are inserted (since generating an index at the beginning\nof a document changes the pagination of the remainder of the file).\nIf you previously generated and accepted an index, you will be asked if you want\nto remove the existing index. Answer Yes to remove the existing index, or No to keep\nit (the newly generated index will be added to the transcript).\nIf you edit your document after indexing, and an item in the index has moved\nto a different page, the location reference in the index is updated automatically.\nFor more details on creating an index automatically, see the Help file \"Indexing\nin More Depth \" or the Automoatic indexing.pdf found on the Advantage Software\nwebsite, at http://www.eclipsecat.com/content/utilities-and-more\n(Note: You must be signed in to your support account at eclipsecat.com to\naccess the documents there.)\nDynamic Index locations\n455\n432\n987\n570\n1120 Eclipse Help\nUnder User settings/Document/Advanced, the option for Dynamic Index\nLocations allows indexes to auto-adjust when edits are made after generating the\nfinal index.\nNew indexes add a special tag to the location format linking to the index\nparagraph in the document, and also preserves page/line tag designations to allow\nthem to be modified. If you view the paragraph label of an index line, you will see\nitems such as {P32} and {L5} and {I281}.\nThe Page/Line numbers in these tags do NOT change. Instead, they preserve the\noriginal index positions. If you turn the \"dynamic index locations\" option OFF, the\nindex lines in the visible transcript display/printout will show the original generated\npage/line numbers. If you turn the option ON, you will see updated page/line\nnumbers on the screen.\nNote that when you make edits, the page/line numbers will NOT be updated\nuntil the program has had a chance to update all of the statistics in the document.\nThis is done in the background (you sometimes see \"updating statistics\" when closing\na document if it's still working on that.) You can force it to update by hitting\nCtrl+PgDn and moving the cursor to the end of the document.\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1121\nThe {I281} tags in the location refer to the index command paragraph numbers.\nThese could theoretically fail if the index line is removed. Modifying doesn't cause a\nproblem, but it also doesn't do anything. The dynamic locations feature does not\nregenerate the index lines, it merely updates the page/line numbers. Note that if the\ndynamic index feature fails to find an index command, it will simply resort to the\noriginally generated page/line numbers.\nMaking a pdf with indexed items\nYou can create additional index categories for PDF files for multi-part indexes by\nplacing descriptive index lines within the created indexes. If you are making a pdf\nwith indexed items, they can be categorized under a header. You can also specify an\nadditional header parent with the HEADER//item text syntax, such as follows:\nix:Witnesses//Joe Smith\nand any index lines for direct/cross/redirect/etc., instead of being inside just a\nJoe Smith index heading, will be placed inside a Witnesses heading, inside a Joe\nSmith subheading.\n23.91 Working with Lesson Player\nWorking With LESSON\nPLAYER\nRELATES TO: Install Lesson , Lesson\nPlayer .\nEclipse's Lesson Player is a way to use the program to teach steno theory.\nCreating A Lesson\nTo create a lesson, create an ordinary text file that contains the contents of\nthe lesson. For example, you could create a lesson that focuses on final-side keys, or\non any aspect of steno shorthand you wish to focus on.\nThe easiest way to create a custom lesson is:\n1. Create a blank note file .\n2. Use the Ctrl+D command to add the desired steno strokes to the note\nfile .\n3. Translate the note file. This will produce a text file, as usual.\n4. Use the Install Lesson command to install the .ECL file.\nLesson Codes\n1002\n1010\n694\n1036 224\n224\n269\n1002\n1122 Eclipse Help\nWhen creating a lesson, you may include a script command that controls the\nbehavior of the lesson. For example, you could make a lesson timed or un-timed; you\ncan show or obscure the steno emulator; or you can show only words and force the\nstudent to come up with the correct steno.\nTo control the behavior of a lesson, insert a Script Command at the\nbeginning of the .ECL file. Then, type one or more of the following codes into the\nscript command:\nÂ· TEXT - this command indicates that this is a test of text, and not of steno theory.\nÂ· U=Name - will load the user named \"Name\" before beginning the lesson. This\nallows you to create lessons that utilize particular user options.\nÂ· NOM - will remove the steno emulator.\nÂ· NOS - will remove the steno. The student will only see the text, and will have to\nwork out the correct steno.\nÂ· S=-1 - displays one word at a time, and asks the user to write it.\nÂ· S=0 - works like S=-1, except that each new word is added to the end of the file,\nlike a regular translation\nÂ· S=X - creates a speed drill where X is the number of words that will appear per\nminute. For example, a setting of S=120 would create a lesson where the words\nwould appear at a rate of 120 words per minute. If the student does not keep up,\nthey will fall behind.\nTo use multiple codes for one lesson, separate them with a pipe symbol. For\nexample, the following script command would show the words at a rate of 90 per\nminute, and will show the steno, but not the steno emulator:\nOnly one S code may be used, but otherwise the codes may be used in any\ncombination.\nInstalling A Lesson\nTo install a lesson, select Install Lesson from the Support menu. Then, select\nthe file you wish to install from the file dialog . The file you select will be copied to\nthe Lessons folder.\nThe Lessons folder is a subfolder of your Jobs folder . When you use the\nLesson Player command to play a lesson, this is the only place it will look. So you\nmust install the lesson, before it can be played.\nPlaying A Lesson\nTo play a lesson, select Lesson Player from the Support menu. Eclipse will\nattempt to establish a realtime connection with a steno machine; if this succeeds, the\nLesson Player dialog will appear. Click Start to begin the lesson.\n367\n108\n1002\n969\n905\n1010\n1010\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1123\n(Note that you can adjust the font for Lesson Player in two ways. First, it follows\nthe Windows scaling setting, making it work better for high-resolution displays, and\nsecondly, it follows the zoom level last set for the lesson player dialog globally This\nadjustment is not made dynamically since the lesson player does not user the\nstandard user interface font, so it may be necessary to zoom the lesson player and\nthen close and re-open the dialog for the font to change.)\nYou will be asked to enter strokes one at a time; if you make a mistake, you'll be\nasked to use the delete stroke to erase it, and then re-write it. If you write the steno\nstroke correctly, you'll move to the next stroke.\nAfter you have written the steno outlines in the lesson, the Lesson Score window\nwill appear, showing your statistics for the lesson.\nViewing Results\nWhen you take a lesson, a file called FILENAMEResults.TXT is created in the\nLessons folder. FILENAME is the name of the lesson file; for example, if you use a\nlesson called Lesson1.ecl, your results file would be Lesson1Results.txt.\nThis file contains a columnar list of statistics:\nÂ· Crect: correct strokes\nÂ· Incrt: incorrect strokes\nÂ· CWords: correct words\nÂ· ToWrd: total number of words in the lesson\nÂ· Dletd: number of deleted strokes\nÂ· Rpeat: number of strokes that were repeated (not including strokes that were\ndeleted and rewritten)\nÂ· Skips: number of strokes skipped (in a speed test)\nÂ· JumpF: number of times the student jumped forward in the file\nÂ· JumpB: number of times the student jumped back in the file\nÂ· usWPM: user's words-per-minute rate\nÂ· toWPM: designated words-per-minute rate of the file\nÂ· Accrt: accuracy rate\nIf you take the same lesson multiple times, this file will contain a different entry\nfor each time you took the lesson.

Create a new text file. Be sure that it is stored in the Blocks folder.\n2. Type a list with one of the items you want to be the choices in your\nscan field on each separate line in the file. When filling in the form, you\nwill be asked to select from that list. You can select items using the\nmouse or keyboard. Include one choice on each line. Like this:\n549\n694\n549\n1036\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1125\n3. Close the file.\nAssigning A List File To A Field\n1. Create a blank field .\n2. Enter the name of the list file into the Use List File text box. You may\neither type the filename directly into the box, or click the Browse\nbutton and select it from the file dialog.\nSorting\nIf you put a comment line at the top of the list containing the word\n\"SORT\" in all caps, the list will appear sorted as you fill in the blanks (but not\nwhen you are editing the list file).\nSelection Criteria\n945\n551\n1126 Eclipse Help\nBy default, you select an item from a list file by typing part of its name.\nAlternatively, you can create shortcut keys to be used when you select an\nitem from the list. They allow you to select items quickly when filling in\nblanks. To designate shortcut keys as you create list items: type what you\nwant to use as the shortcut, then the at symbol @ , then type the list\nentry. This is most useful when items in a list are very similar to each other\n(such as March and May).\nTo do this, precede the item with the selection criteria you want to use,\nand then the @ sign. Like this:\nYou may now type 1 to select Monday, 2 to select Tuesday, etc.\nThe selection criteria can be letters or numbers. For example, you may\nwant to use an attorney's last name as a selection criteria:\nNote that you can use the _ literal character command in the list\nprocessor, which will allow you to put in things like jthorne_@eclipsecat.com,\nand it won't see the \"@\" as a signal to make \"jthorne\" a shortcut string for\nthe list. This also works with the plus sign.\nMulti-Line List Files\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1127\nA list file may be used to fill in more than one field at a time. This\ntechnique is most commonly used on the Appearances page, where the\nnames and addresses of attorneys are given.\nTo create a multi-line list file, type each piece of text into the same\nparagraph, separated by plus signs. Like this:\nThere are three pieces of information here: \"Advantage Software\", \"925\nCentral Parkway\", and \"Stuart, Florida 34994\", separated by plus signs. Each\nof these items will go into a separate field.\nNote that the text wraps to the next line. This is normal. Each paragraph\nshould contain one set of information.\nTo use a multi-line list file, create as many blanks the information calls\nfor. In the above example, you would need three blanks. Then, assign only\nthe first blank to use the list file. When you fill in the first blank, the\nremaining blanks will fill in automatically.\nIf the number of blanks you will need may vary, create the maximum\nnumber of blanks you will need, and use the Delete Line If Empty attribute.\nAlso, at some point in the list file entry, include one additional plus for each\nfield you will not be using. For example, if an address is only three lines long\nbut you need to create four fields (to account for other attorneys who have\nfour-line addresses), the entry would read:\nAdvantage Software++925 Central Parkway+Stuart Florida, 34994\nSelecting from list files\n1128 Eclipse Help\nThe list file selection dialog contains a number of choices.\nÂ· The Edit button allows you to edit the list file before selecting an item. This\nbutton opens the list file document and escapes out of the fill-in-the-blanks\nprocess. It jumps to the currently highlighted item on the list. Once you\nare done editing the list, close it and you will see that your cursor is still in\nthe original document in the appropriate location to continue filling in\nblanks. Just hit Ctrl+E or whatever keystroke you normally use for filling in\nblanks to continue.\nÂ· The Sort button arranges the entries in the list file alphabetically.\nÂ· The Details button will show you the additional field details for the\ncurrently highlighted list item\nÂ· If the list file includes shortcut keys, you can type the item s shortcut to\nselect it.\nÂ· You can create a new list entry by typing it in the editing field and clicking\nAdd. You can then select the item and press Enter. Note that you can even\nadd entries containing the + sign to indicate multiple fields worth of data\nMerging and sorting items from multiple list files, and\ndeleting duplicates\nIf you work with block files containing long lists of attorneys or other\nitems you use with the form fields feature, you may need a way to sort the\nlists. You can do this by putting a comment line at the top of the list with the\nword SORT in the comment, as described above. But if you have two or more\nlists that you wish to sort and combine together, you can place the cursor on\nthe \"SORT\" comment line and hit Read block (Alt+R) and read the second\nblock into the first, and Eclipse will detect the fact that they are sorted lists\nand will ask the following question:\nDelete duplicates and re-sort list? (yes / no)\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1129\nIf you answer yes, the second list will be merged with the first and\nduplicates will be eliminated. The list will then be sorted and regenerated in\nthe file.\nInserting fields during translation\nYou can include {FL:FieldSyntax} in a dictionary entry to insert a field\nduring translation.

A multi-page transcript is also known as a compressed transcript, or a\nfour-in-one transcript.\nTo print a multi-page transcript, simply print the transcript as usual, , and\nselect either Multi-page or Multi-page with Index from the drop-down list on the\nPrint dialog .\nThe Options button on the Print dialog will open the Multi-page Printout\nOptions dialog , where you can control the appearance of your multi-page\ntranscripts.\nMulti-page pre-sets\nMulti-page can be daunting to set up because there are so many options. Market\nresearch shows that nearly everyone, no matter what multi-page software they use,\nconforms to a nearly universal standard: Four pages per sheet, a four-part box drawn\naround all of the pages, a binding margin on the left, custom headers on the top and\nbottom, and just the 25 numbered lines and page numbers within the boxes.\nIn order to make it easier to set up, The multi-page dialog offers five styles,\nlabeled \"Style 1, Style 2 ...\" in the drop-list at the top of the multi-page dialog. Select\na style and hit the \"View sample\" button to see a sample of a transcript creating using\nthe selected style. Examples can be seen here.\nIf you wish to use that style, hit the \"Select\" button and all of the multi-page\nsettings will be changed so that your multi-page printout will look like the sample.\n797\n850\n600 601\n610\n600\n601\n601\n610\n612\n1130 Eclipse Help\nIf you wish to customize from there, it will be much easier to start with a predefined\nstyle and tweak a few items than to start from scratch and try to set\neverything manually.\nThe five styles are, in summary:\nâ¢ Style 1: Boxed pages, Two-line header and footer, Arial and Courier fonts, Bold\nanswers\nâ¢ Style 2: Boxed pages, one-line header and footer, Times New Roman and\nLucida Console fonts\nâ¢ Style 3: Individual page boxes, individual headers/footers on each page from\nthe original transcript, Arial fonts\nâ¢ Style 4: Timecodes left\nâ¢ Style 5: Timecodes right\nCustomization hint 1: Fonts and font sizes are the easiest things to change. Pick\na style based on the overall shape of the layout and change the fonts from there.\nChanging the number of header lines, or the layout of the boxes, is trickier since you\nthen may have to adjust other items to fit around them, so don't pick a style based on\nthe fonts and then try to add more header lines, for example.\nCustomization hint 2: The headers are pre-built with job variables that may not\nmatch what you use. Replace them with your own, or simply type text in their place,\nbeing careful not to delete or add pipe | characters.\nWord Index\nA word index, also known as a word list or concordance, is a list of words that\nappears in a transcript, indexed to the volume, page and line number they appear on.\nTo print a word index, select Multi-Page With Index, Full Size with Index, or\nIndex Only from the drop-down list on the Print dialog , and then click OK to\nprint.\nMulti-page document overrides\nIn order to get the multi-page document to conform precisely to expectations, it\nis almost always necessary to override some of the document's full-sized settings,\nsuch as margins, spacing, etc.\nAs of Version 7, Eclipse has every document setting that you are likely to want\nto override built into the multi-page option dialog so that they can be overridden\neasily. If you simply want the lines in the multi-page to be spaced out a bit more, just\ngo to the multi-page dialog and select \"line spacing\" and make it slightly larger than\nthe line spacing in the document.\nThe .set file mechanism is there if you need to override something that is not on\nthe list.\nMost of the settings are numerical and are presented as a droplist/number box\nmechanism. The index columns and index threshold are consolidated into this list.\n617\n601\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1131\nHere is a list of the settings in the multi-page dialog and what they do. Note\nthat any setting that is specifically an override of a document setting should be set to\n-1 if you want to keep using the original document setting for that metric.\nâ¢ Page Format -- overrides the document's page format since many multi-page\nformats prefer \"page X\" on the multi-page document but just \"X\" on the fullsized\nversion.\nâ¢ Maximum text width -- Set this to prevent fonts from extending outside the\nbox. The text is not allowed to exceed this distance. If you have a large\nnumber of capital letters on a line, it will not poke the line out the right side of\nthe box. Instead, it will shrink the font just for that one line so that it fits\nwithin this measurement.\nâ¢ Row 1 offset, Row 2 offset, Column 1 offset, Column 2 offset -- the\ndistance that the rows or columns of miniaturized pages move up, down, left or\nright (can be positive or negative.) Use to fit the page more precisely inside\nwhatever borders you have selected. These numbers are set for you when you\nuse a pre-defined format, but you can adjust these values without affecting\nanything else.\nâ¢ Top margin -- overrides the top margin of the document. Note that this will\nNOT affect the top margin of the multi-page document. It affects the top\nmargin of the individual miniaturized pages. Extra space at the top of a multipage\noutput is generally not desirable, but can be accomplished by adding\nadditional empty header lines (examples provided in the preset samples.)\nâ¢ Left margin -- overrides the left margin of the document. In multi-page, this\nwill be the binding margin on the left side before the left edge of the box. If\nyou select Left margin/Full-sized, duplexed, then the full-sized document as\nwell as the multi-page document will print with a binding margin appearing\nalternately on the left and right sides of the paper.\nâ¢ Right margin -- Documents don't use a right margin since each paragraph\nuses its own margins. Set this when you need to dictate how much space there\nis between the right side of the paper and the automatically drawn multi-page\nboxes.\nâ¢ Footer offset -- The location of the footer is determined by the page size and\nnumber of footer lines. The automatic position may not be precisely what\nyou're looking for, so this number (which defaults to zero) gives you a way to\ntell the software to put the footer higher or lower on the page. Keep in mind\nthat this will stretch the automatic boxes, so adjust this value after deciding\nhow many footer lines you want, and before you adjust the row 1 and 2 offsets.\nâ¢ Header margin, footer margin -- overrides the header/footer margins of the\ndocument. Does not affect the multi-page headers and footers, only the\nreduced-size individual page versions, as in Style 3.\nâ¢ Line height -- overrides the line height of the document. Use this to stretch\nout the lines farther apart or put them close together.\nâ¢ Character spacing -- overrides the character spacing of the document. Note\nthat this only applies to fixed-space fonts, but this can be particularly useful if\n1132 Eclipse Help\nyou want to maximize the font size for the fixed-space portions of the\ntranscript, since the spacing can be adjusted independently from the font\nheight.\nâ¢ Line number margin -- overrides the line number margin of the document.\nâ¢ Page number row, page number column -- overrides the page number\nposition of the document. Use in conjunction with the page format field to\ncustomize what multi-page page numbers look like. You can add a line number\nformatting option in the page number format separated by a pipe sign. For\nexample {P####}|{L<0###} shows up to a four-digit page number and will\npad all line numbers to three digits with zeros, such as 005, 012, etc.\nâ¢ Timecode margin -- overrides the timecode margin of the document. None of\nthe built-in samples have timecodes appearing on the multi-page output.\nTimecodes are difficult to put on a multi-page output and still be reasonably\nreadable, so they should usually be limited to the full-sized output. If you need\nto include timecodes, the fonts will have to be reduced and margins adjusted.\nâ¢ Paragraph number margin -- overrides the paragraph number margin of the\ndocument.\nâ¢ Text box left, top, width, height -- Using the original text box from the fullsized\ndocument only works if you don't change any of the margins. Once you\nstart changing the margins, line height, etc., it no longer fits. These\nadjustments allow you to specify an exact location for the multi-page version of\nthe text box that is used to outline each separate miniaturized page, as in\nStyle 3.\nMulti-page header/footer with job variables\nYou can put job variables from the form field system into the header and footer\nby using {VARNAME} anywhere in the header/footer, so you won't have to type the\nwitness name, the case number, the current date, etc., in three or four different\nplaces.\nSo, for example, if you have a field with a variable called WITNAME where you\ntype the witness, and another where you fill in the DATE (or maybe MONTH, DAY and\nYEAR) you can just put {WITNAME} and {DATE} (or {MONTH}, {DAY} {YEAR}) in\nthe multi-page header/footer box.\nThe default Style 1-3 presets hint at this by putting {WITNESSNAME} and\n{DATE}, etc., in the header/footer that are created when you select a preset.\nKeep in mind that the multi-page header/footer settings are permanent, so if\nyou want them to be different for each printout, you have to manually go in and\nchange them each time.\nDetails on the syntax for headers and footers can be found here.\nMulti-page full-sized Cover Page\nThis feature prints a decorative cover page as the first sheet in a multi-page\nprintout. (Note that is does not print the regular title page in full size.)\n615\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1133\nYou can access this from the User settings/Programming tab, under \"Cover\npage.\" If you leave it blank, no cover page will be printed. The cover page is always\nprinted using an enlarged version of the default multi-page font, for consistency's\nsake. It also always prints each line centered, and centers the entire body of the text\nvertically.\nSo, for example, you could type the following as your cover page:\nIn the matter of\n__________________________\nJoe Consumer, Plaintiff\nv.\nVery Large Corporation, Defendant\nCase no. 123456\n__________________________\nDeposition of\nMillicent Bystander\n__________________________\nJanuary 16, 2015\nat the offices of\nSuperlative Court Reporting\n800-555-1234\n...and you would get a decorative cover page before your multi-page output.\nYou can also use Job variables, and type this into the cover page:\nIn the matter of\n__________________________\n{PLAINTIFF1}, Plaintiff\nv.\n{DEFENDANT1}, Defendant\nCase no. {CASENUM}\n1134 Eclipse Help\n__________________________\nDeposition of\n{WITNESSNAME}\n__________________________\n{DATE}\nat the offices of\nSuperlative Court Reporting\n800-555-1234\nKeep in mind that if there is a large amount of variation between the cover\npages for the types of transcripts that you do, a template like this might not be\nflexible enough.\nIn this case, you can add additional variables to replace things like the words\n\"Plaintiff\" and \"Defendant\" just as you would on a title page.\nIf your cover pages are so variable that they cannot be templatized, you can still\nmake them document specific by simply putting a series of lines in the Cover Page\nthat read {COVER1}, {COVER2}, {COVER3}, etc., for as many lines as you need,\nthen add a series of comment lines in your document above your title page containing\nthose fields. Whatever you fill into those fields would appear on the cover page.\nVISUALIZERS:\nI1 - Printing\nI3 - Multi-page\nI3 - Multi-page Settings\nI3a - Multi-page Index\nI1a - Delivery\n23.94 Working with Multiple Dictionaries\nWorking With MULTIPLE\nDICTIONARIES\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1135\nWhen you translate a job, one or more dictionaries will be used in the translation.\nYour Main dictionary is always used. In addition, you may use a Job dictionary and/or\none or more User dictionaries to further refine the translation.\nJob Dictionaries\nEach job you do will have a Job dictionary (unless you manually remove it from\nthe Dictionaries dialog ). The Job dictionary is a dictionary of entries relevant to\nthis job only, such as names and terms from the current case. The job dictionary will\nbe created one of two ways:\nÂ· By default, Eclipse will create a job dictionary when you begin the translation. The\njob dictionary will have the same name as the text file.\nÂ· You can set up a Master Job dictionary. To do this, go to the User tab of User\nSettings, click the Dictionaries button, and assign a dictionary to the Job slot on the\nDictionaries dialog .\nIt is useful to set up a Master Job dictionary when you have to produce a series of\nindividual transcripts that will all take the same job dictionary, such as an ongoing\ncase. Rather than re-create the Job dictionary entries each session, you can re-use the\njob dictionary you made on the first day by selecting it as Master Job.\nIf you designate a Master Job dictionary, Eclipse will not create the job dictionary\nthat has the same name as the transcript.\nWhether your Job dictionary is a Master Job or not, any globals made using\nCtrl+J will go into that dictionary.\nUser Dictionaries\nA User dictionary is another dictionary that can be used in addition to Main and\nJob. Typically, this slot is used for specialty dictionaries, such as a dictionary of terms\npertaining to medical malpractice, asbestos, family court, captioning, or whatever\ntype of work you do.\nThere are two advantages to using a User dictionary for these types of entries.\nFirst, not putting them into the main dictionary keeps the main dictionary efficient,\nand eliminates the possibility of writing these entries accidentally when you are\nreporting a different type of case. Second, this practice allows you to re-use briefs.\nYou can use the same steno to mean different things in different User dictionaries. As\nlong as you select your extra dictionaries correctly for each job, you are assured of the\ncorrect translation.\nUser dictionaries are optional. Unlike the Main or Job, you do not have to use one,\nand Eclipse will not create one by default.\nTo create a User dictionary, create a new dictionary file , and assign it to a\nUser slot on the Dictionaries dialog .\nTo global into a User dictionary, press the Ctrl key plus the number of the\nUser dictionary. Ctrl+1 would place the global in the User 1 dictionary, Ctrl+2 would\nput it into User 2, etc.\n955\n101\n955\n326\n1036\n955\n326\n1136 Eclipse Help\nMaking Permanent Dictionary Selections\nThe scope of changes made on the Dictionaries dialog is dependent upon\nwhere you access it from. If you access it via the Dictionaries button on the User\ntab , your selections will be the default for all future jobs. This is the best way to\nselect a Master Job dictionary, since you generally want it to be in effect for multiple\njobs.\nIf you select extra dictionaries this way, you may want to uncheck Use In\nTranslation. If you do, the dictionaries will be pre-selected, but each time you begin a\ntranslation you can turn on just the ones you want to use for that job. This allows you\nto pre-select every extra dictionary you might ever use (as User dictionaries), and\nthen from the Translate Notes/Dictionaries dialog check Use In Translation only\nfor the ones you wish to use in today's transcript.\nIf you access the Dictionaries dialog from the Dictionaries button on the\nTranslate Notes dialog, the changes you make will be for that translation only.\n(Again, the default setup will be whatever you chose from the User tab.)\nIf you access it by pressing F9 when a (previously-translated) text file is\nopen, the changes you make will pertain to the dictionary assignments for that job.\nFor example, you could assign a new dictionary to place Job or User globals into,\neven if that dictionary was not used in the translation of the job.\nDictionary Priority\n1. Job (highest priority)\n2. User 1\n3. User 2\n4. User 3, etc., through User 8, in numerical order\n5. Main (lowest priority)\nThe priority only matters if the same steno appears in two or more of the\ndictionaries that are in use. If it does, the definition from the higher-priority dictionary\nwill be used.\nVISUALIZERS: H1 - Dictionary Selection\nH1a - Change Translating Dictionaries\n23.95 Working with Note Files\nWorking With Note Files\n955\n101\n955\n269\n694\n326\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1137\nRELATES TO: Read Notes , Translate Notes , Open\nNotes .\nNotes files are raw steno files. Usually, they are created by reading notes\nfrom your steno machine into Eclipse. Even after you translate a note file, the raw\nnote file itself will remain. A realtime job will also produce a note file. Note files\nhave an .NOT extension , and can be retranslated.\nWhen a note file is open, you can quickly translate it by pressing Alt+T. You\nwill be taken to the Translate Notes dialog, with the current note file already\nselected.\nAlt+M will toggle Translate Mode on and off. When Translate Mode is active,\na translated version of the raw steno will appear at right. When it is off, you will see\nphonetics instead.\nThe following Eclipse editing actions can also be done on note files:\nÂ· Moving around , using the applicable basic cursor movements .\nÂ· You can perform globals from within a note file, just as you would in a text\nfile .\nÂ· Block read , block write , and other block operations can be performed\non note files, allowing you to merge or split them quickly.\nÂ· You can search a note file. Enter the desired steno into the steno\nemulator .\nÂ· You can go to a stroke or fold number.\nÂ· You can add new steno outlines to a note file by using the Add Dictionary\nEntry command (Ctrl+D). The steno emulator will appear, and any\nsteno strokes you enter will be added to the end of the note file. This allows\nyou to create and add to steno files without having a machine present,\nperhaps for educational or testing purposes.\nÂ· You can run Tools/Job report while in a note file, and get statistics just\nbased on the notes. This includes the total number of strokes, the total\nnumber of strokes deleted, and then a breakdown of the number of times\neach key was pressed, the number of times each key was deleted, and a\nproportional comparison of the two accurate to five decimal places (since you\nprobably care more about how often you delete a particular key compared to\nother keys, rather than the pure number of times you deleted it.)\n230 269\n232\n230\n269\n483\n971\n269\n358\n236 312\n326\n694\n392 393 392\n320\n893\n988\n173 893\n1138 Eclipse Help\nin the example above, the reporter hit the K key 2699 times, of which 15 times\nwere deleted.

However, it does\nrequire some setup.\nHere's how it works: any time you write a series of \"number words\", Eclipse will\nexamine them as a group, and produce a formatted number based on your\npreferences. You set your preferences on the Numbers tab .\nDictionary Entries\nFirst, you must put number words into your dictionary:\nÂ· 0 through 20, written out. (You do not need dictionary entries for number bar\nstrokes, unless they mean something other than the numbers themselves.)\nÂ· 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90.\nÂ· hundred, thousand, million, billion, etc.\nÂ· 21 through 99, but only if you write them as one-stroke entries: TWUPN for 21,\nTWAO for 22, TWAOE for 23, etc. If you write multi-stroke entries TWEPBT/WUPB,\nTWEPBT/TO, etc., no entry is needed.\nÂ· Either the word \"point\", or an entry defined as {DECIMAL} for a decimal point.\nÂ· Ordinals: first, second, third, etc., or a stroke that will convert a number to an\nordinal. You may make entries for {^st}, {^nd}, {^rd}, and {^th}, or a {#O}\nentry.\nÂ· Words for units of measure (feet, gallons); time (o'clock, a.m., p.m.); money\n(dollars), etc.\nOnce your dictionary has all the necessary entries, you must then remove any\nredundant entries. Redundant entries are entries that can be written with a\ncombination of existing entries. Redundant entries can cause problems with number\nconversion.\n264\n264\n1140 Eclipse Help\nThis is an example of a redundant entry:\nSEUBS HUPB = 600\nThis entry is redundant, because you have separate dictionary entries for:\nSEUBS = six\nHUPB = hundred\nEclipse will automatically combine the two entries to generate \"six hundred.\"\nIf you're getting results such as SEUBGS/HUPB/TWEPBT = \"600 twenty\", the\nproblem is most likely a redundant entry.\nPreferences\nOnce your dictionary is set up, you will then set your preferences on the\nNumbers tab .\nNumber Conversion Codes\nThe Numbers tab controls only general preferences. There are some instances\nwhere you will always want a number to be in digits, such as Exhibit numbers. To\naccomplish this, include number conversion codes in your dictionary entries.\nConversion codes can be written before, after, or even during the number series\nthey affect. They will change the appearance of the entire number series.\nHere is a list of the most commonly-used number conversion codes, and what\neach one does:\nCode What It Converts To Example Explanation\n{#G} Convert to generic digits. Exhibit{#\nG}\nEnsures that any number\nfollowing the word \"Exhibit\" will\nappear as digits.\nCan also be part of a conflict:\n\\exhibit\\Exhibit{#G}\n{#N} Convert an ordinal or dollar amount\nto its numeric form.\n{#N} of\nApril\nEnsures that any ordinal\npreceding the word \"April\" will\nappear in its numeric form, e.g.\n\"3rd of April\".\n{#T} Convert to time. {#T}\nIf you write SEUBGS/THEURT/\n{#T}, you will get 6:30.\nIs typically a stand-alone entry.\n{#D} Convert to a date. {#D} If you write SEUBGS/THEURT/\n{#T}, you will get 6/30.\n264\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1141\nCode What It Converts To Example Explanation\nIs typically a stand-alone entry.\n{#M} Convert to money. {#M}\nIf the deponent says \"fifty\" in\nresponse to a question about a\ndollar amount, you can write 50/\n{#M} and it will be formatted as\na dollar amount.\n{#O} Convert to ordinal. {#O}\nYou can create an ordinal by\nwriting an ordinary number, and\nwriting {#O} adjacent to it.\nOther number conversion codes:\nCode Converts To...\n{#W} written out\n{#R} Roman numerals **\n{#r} Roman numerals, lower case\n{#C} money subunit (cents)\n{#Q} quantity\n{#P} Phone number\n{#1} through {#9} User-defined format .\n** The Number converter can auto-detect and reverse-convert roman numerals\nback to digits.

Spacing and\ncapitalization will be adjusted as needed.\nFor example, if you have this sentence:\nPressing the period key on the keyboard, while the cursor is on the beginning of\nthe word \"now\", would produce:\nYou can change this to a different punctuation mark, simply by pressing the key\nyou wish to change to. Spacing and capitalization will again be adjusted, if necessary:\nNote that punctuation editing is done with the cursor on the beginning of the\nfollowing word. This allows you to do the entire punctuation edit in one keystroke,\ninstead of having to manually space, capitalize, etc. each time.\nTo remove a punctuation mark, press the Backspace key. If you use the\nBackspace key to remove a punctuation mark, you can do so from the beginning of\nthe following word, and for any punctuation defined in the metadictionary, it will\nremove any associated case changes, spaces, etc. For example, in a piece of text such\nas âHe. Went homeâ you can place the cursor on the âWâ and hit the backspace key\nto remove the period, the extra space and down-case the âW.â\nIf the cursor is not at the beginning of a word, pressing a punctuation key will\nsimply insert the mark at that point. This can be useful in situations where you need\nto insert a punctuation mark into the middle of a word (for websites, or a name with\ninitials), or put multiple punctuation marks next to each other (for phrases such as \"it\nwas six a.m., I believe.\") Note that Jump Punctuation Left will have to be\nunchecked, as this command will make all punctuation inserts behave as if the cursor\nis on the beginning of the word.\nIf you type a punctuation command which does not have a cap command in its\nmetadictionary entry, when that punctuation is typed before a capped word or is used\nto replace a terminal punctuation mark such as a period, the word will be downcapped\nif the lower-case version is correctly spelled.\nOther Punctuation Commands\nÂ· You can insert/change terminal punctuation to a period, question mark, or\ndash .\n694\n307\n357\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1143\nÂ· The following commands will place the punctuation mark at the end of the\nsentence, replacing any other terminal punctuation mark:\nTo place a Period: Alt+P\nTo place a Question mark: Alt+Q\nTo place a Double dash (- -): Alt+D\nChanges to the behavior of these and other punctuation commands can be done\nusing the Metadictionary. WARNING: If you are an inexperienced user, you should not\nattempt to edit your metadictionary without expert guidance.\nBy default, the period, question mark, and double dash will be followed by two\nspaces. If you want to change that to one space, for example if you are exporting the\ndocument to be published in a proportional font, you can change the\nMetadictionary entries. In User settings/Programming/Metadictionary, select\nthe entry, {.} for example. and change the \"Force right boundary text\" from two\nspaces to one.\nAnother default behavior controls capitalization after a colon. The default\nbehavior inserts a space after the colon, and the next word will be capitalized. If you\ndo not insert a space, the next word will be lower case. So if you are using the colon\nbefore a list of items, for example, do not insert a space.\nSimilarly, if you do not want a lockspace before a double dash, you can edit the\nMetadictionary entry, removing the lockspace. You would simply change the entry\nfrom\n{--}={/<^[,;?~]~/\"[-][]--/?DPC} to\n{--}={/<^[,;?~]/\"[-][]--/?DPC}\nÂ· You can use block marking to perform some quick punctuation edits, such as\nsurrounding a phrase with commas or quotation marks, or hyphenating a multiword\nphrase.\nÂ· Toggle apostrophe .\nÂ· If the metadictionary entry for a particular punctuation mark doesn't have a cap\ncommand in it, then when that punctuation is typed before a capped word or is\nused to replace a terminal punctuation mark such as a period, the word will be\ndown-capped if the lower-case version is correctly spelled.\nApostrophes\n805\n395\n357\n1144 Eclipse Help\nTo convert a word to its possessive form, place the cursor in the word and press\nAlt+A. This is a 3-way toggle. The first Alt+A will add 's. If the word ends in s, the\nfirst Alt+A will make it into 's. The second Alt+A will change it to s' and the third will\nremove the apostrophe altogether. If the word is already in possessive form, this\ncommand will open a menu. (See discussion below)\nYou can also use the Edit menu/Miscellaneous/Flip apostrophe command.\nFlip apostrophe (Alt+A) and contractions\nFor words ending in \"s,\" hitting Alt+A will cycle from s to s', then 's, then s'\nagain. Because 's can either be a possessive or a contraction of \"is\" or \"has,\" the\nsecond time cycling through Alt+A will bring up an alternates menu similar to the\nillustration below, based on \"doctor's.\" It will include xxxxs's in the cycle for items\nsuch as \"Jones's\" and \"witness's.\"\nAny common contraction can be toggled to its expanded form by putting the\ncursor on it and hitting Alt+A.\nFor example: don't --> do not\nNote that the cursor will be left on the \"n\" in \"not\" when you do this. That's\nbecause any two-word phrase that can be contracted can be converted to its\ncontraction by putting the cursor on the second or contracted word. For example: he\nwill --> he'll (the cursor must be on the \"w\" in \"will\").\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1145\nBecause some contractions could be several forms of phrases (\"where'd he go\nyesterday\" \"where'd you like to go tomorrow\" \"she'd have to go\" \"she'd better go\"),\nwhen hitting Alt+A on a word ending in 'd you will get a menu containing\ned/had/would/did so that you can select which one it should be. You can select the\ncorrect choice by highlighting and hitting Enter or clicking OK, or by typing the\nnumber of the choice.\nThe Alt+A contractions feature gives two options when executed on a word\nending in \"ing.\" It will bring up a menu to change it to in' or to add 's as this feature\ndoes with most words.\nUnconventional spellings are included in the list of possible choices for some\nwords. For example, if you try to contract \"should have\" you will get a menu\ncontaining \"should've\" or \"shoulda.\"\nCustom contractions\nMany contractions are fairly basic and easily customized. You can use the default\nlist in the User settings/Programming tab \"Contractions\" list, remove any you\ndon't want, and add your own.\nThe default list is:\nÂ· am+not=ain't\nÂ· shall+not=shan't\nÂ· will+not=won't\nÂ· I+am=I'm\nÂ· it+was='twas\nÂ· let+us=let's\n826\n1146 Eclipse Help\nÂ· going+to=gonna\nÂ· got+to=gotta\nÂ· want+to=wanna\nYou can use this feature both for contractions, and for any common error in which\none word becomes two or two words become one.\nReverse ? and /\nMost reporters need to type a question mark more often than they do the slash,\nso many prefer to switch the slash and question mark keys. That way they don't have\nto use the Shift and slash key to get a question mark.\nTo set your keyboard to use the slash for the question mark (and Shift / to enter\na slash) go to User settings/Edit tab , and mark the checkbox for Reverse ? and /\n.\nJump punctuation left\nYou can easily change a paragraph from one format to another, or insert (start) a\nnew paragraph. Notice that, along the left side of the document window, a lettered\nbutton appears adjacent to each paragraph. The letter on the button indicates the\nparagraph's format (e.g. Q=Question paragraph). Clicking a paragraph button opens\nthe Paragraph Data dialog, which you can use to assign a different format to the\nparagraph or to change characteristics of that single paragraph.\nNote that if the top of the screen is the middle of a paragraph, the paragraph\nbutton in the margin will still appear to let you know what sort of paragraph it is (and\nto allow you to change it, if desired.)\nDictionary Entries\nIn general, dictionary entries for punctuation marks should be in braces:\nSyntax Mark\n{.} period\n{,} comma\n{?} question mark\n{;} semi-colon\n{:} colon\nFor more advanced punctuation entries, see the page on dictionary entry\nsyntax .\nAutomatic Punctuation\n306\n958\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1147\nThe following punctuation marks apply automatically to the previous word:\ncomma, period, question mark, colon, semicolon, dash, hyphen, double-quote and\nsingle quote. The double and single quotes cycle between applying to the current\nword (begin quote) and the previous word (end quote).\nIf you do not write a punctuation mark at the end of a paragraph, Eclipse will\nautomatically insert an appropriate punctuation mark for the type of paragraph it is.\nThe mark you will get is determined by the Behaves As setting, on the Advanced\nParagraph Data settings from the Paragraphs tab.\nNote that choosing to turn off Auto capitalization in User settings/Edit tab\nonly tells Eclipse not to capitalize a word just because your cursor passes over it. It\ndoes not interfere with the Automatic punctuation's effect on capitalization.\nTyping a dash will not remove a period after an abbreviation\nThis goes for all punctuation, including commas and semicolons. The software\nlooks at the previous word and looks it up in the metadictionary. If that word is\nregistered as a title, the period will not be removed. Note that you can customize the\nmetadictionary to add additional titles beyond Mr., Mrs., Dr., Sgt., etc.\nSoft commas in Automatic Punctuation\nIf an entry ends in a soft comma and the next thing you write is a paragraph\nentry, the automatic punctuation for that paragraph entry will erase the comma\nbefore applying to the paragraph. For example, you can write a single entry\n{,?}okay{,?}\nand it will work in all of the following situations, where none of the following\ncommas was written by the reporter:\nÂ· Q. State your name.\nÂ· A. Well, okay, it's John.\nÂ· Q. Okay, and what's your last name?\nÂ· A. Do I have to tell you?\nÂ· Q. Yes you do, okay?\nÂ· A. Okay.\nÂ· Q.

These choices are saved in your User Settings, so\nyou don't have to select them each time.\nOnce those settings are in place, you can begin the realtime job from the\nTranslate Notes dialog, or with the Instant Realtime button.\nDoing a transcript in realtime also allows you to record audio , and/or send\nrealtime output .\nHardware\nMost writer types require a COM port to do realtime. This is a nine-pin port that\nyour writer physically plugs into.\nIf your computer does not have a COM port, you will need to produce one, by\npurchasing a USB-to-serial adapter. This device costs about $50. It plugs into a USB\nport, and has a COM port on the other end; your writer will plug into that. To install\nthis device, follow the instructions that come with it.\nAlternatively, you may use a PCMCIA card. This device is more expensive,\nhowever, and can only be used if your computer has available card slots (which most\ndesktop computers do not).\nWhether you have a built-in COM port, or if you purchased an external device to\ngenerate one, Eclipse needs to know the COM port number. To determine this:\n1. In Windows, click Start/Settings Control Panel/System.\n2. Click the Hardware tab.\n3. Click the Device Manager button. The Device Manager dialog will open:\n230 269\n947\n226\n271 486\n649\n519\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1149\n4. Click the plus sign to the left of \"Ports (COM & LPT)\".\n5. A list of all available ports on this computer will appear, indented beneath the\n\"Ports (COM & LPT)\" heading.\n6. Write down the number that appears for the COM port. In the above graphic, it\nis COM3. If you installed a device, it will be plainly described as \"USB to Serial\nAdapter\", along with a brand name and a COM number.\nThis is the number that Eclipse needs when selecting your writer/COM port on\nthe Input tab , or when selecting a COM port for output in Output Formats .\nVISUALIZERS:\n226 520\n1150 Eclipse Help\nvD2a_Alt+T_for_Realtime.mp4\nvD2a_Instant_Realtime.mp4\nvD3_Pending_Tran_Split_Window.mp4\nvD3_Realtime_Setup.mp4\nvD3a_Realtime_Output.mp4\nvD3a_Realtime_Output_Buffer.mp4\nvD3b_Bridge.mp4\nvD3b_Bridge_Pro.mp4\nvD3c Bridge Mobile.mp4\nvD3_Add_Serial_Port.mp4\nvD3_Device_Manager.mp4\nvG5_RT_Kit.mp4\nvD3a_Wireless.mp4\n23.99 Working with Realtime Editing\nWorking With REALTIME\nEDITING\nRELATES TO: Realtime , Assigning a\nDictionary Entry to a Macro , Macro\nEditor , Realtime tab , Edit Toggles .\nThere are two ways to edit a transcript in realtime: you can have a scopist editing\nat your computer while you write in realtime, or you can perform editing functions via\nsteno keystrokes.\nRealtime Scoping\nTo scope a realtime job, all you have to do is sit at their computer and take\ncontrol of the cursor. You will need to uncheck Follow Always on the Realtime tab .\nYou may also find it useful to set up a split view of the realtime job, either with\nthe Split Window item on the Realtime tab , or via Window menu/Split . This\nallows you two different views of the transcript at once; the scopist can edit a\nprevious section of the transcript in one pane, while the reporter follows the realtime\njob in the other.\n483\n1020\n1018 487 963\n487\n487 1085\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1151\nEven if you're not working with a scopist, you can perform edits from the\ncomputer keyboard during breaks. Just take control of the cursor with the computer\nkeyboard and edit as normal. The reverse scans are useful here. Alternatively, you\ncan check Stop Follow On Unresolved on the Realtime tab; this will leave the\ncursor at the first trouble spot. From there you can fix the first one, and then scan\nforward to the others.\nEditing From The Writer\nEdit Mode allows a wide variety of editing directly from the steno machine or\nusing voice input both during realtime and during the editing phase.\nThe process of making edits from the steno machine is described in detail in the\ndocument Eclipse Realtime Kit.pdf which is found in the Eclipse\nDocumentation folder.\nTo make edits from the steno machine, you will assign macros to dictionary\nentries. When you write the steno outline, the editing action will be performed.\nFor example, here is a simple realtime editing action:\nThis series of steps will reverse scan to the most recent conflict , select\nchoice 1, retransmit the text to realtime output , and then move back to the\nbottom of the job . By creating a macro of these steps, and then assigning that\nmacro to a dicionary entry , we can perform the entire editing function from the\nsteno machine.\nAll realtime editing functions work on this same principle: you will assign a\nmacro to a dictionary entry, and press the entry to perform the edit.\n340\n487\n339\n425\n31\n1018\n340\n1049\n313\n1020\n1152 Eclipse Help\nWhile you can make your own macros, macros for a great many functions have\nbeen premade for you, and were included when you first created your user. Check the\nEclipse Realtime Kit.pdf file in the Eclipse Documentation folder for a detailed\nlist of macros, and how each one works.\nGlobaling From The Writer\nWhile globaling from the writer works on these same principles, it is a more\ncomplex function. Performing a global from the writer is a three-step process:\n1. Press a steno outline to back to the last untranslate, open it for globaling, and\nenter Keymode or Correction mode.\n2. Write or fingerspell the definition into the global dialog .\n3. Press a steno outline to select the global type , return to Normal translation\nmode, and move the cursor to the bottom of the job.\nWhen globaling from the writer, you will use either Keymode or Correction Mode.\nKeymode allows you to finger-spell into the global dialog; Correction Mode allows you\nto write existing dictionary entries into the global dialog. (Correction mode is for\nquickly correcting untranslates.)\nEither mode will use KEYMODE.DIX, which is the keymode dictionary. Any\nfunctions that need to be performed while you are in the global dialog -- such as\nselecting a global type, typing a space, or capitalizing a global -- need to be stored in\nthis dictionary.\nThe following default macros will perform global corrections from the writer:\nÂ· Go Define Untran - scans back to the last untranslate, turns on Keymode so you\ncan fingerspell the definition into the globaling window.\nÂ· Go Correct Untran - scans back to the last untranslate, turns on Correction\nMode so you can write the correct outline into the globaling window.\nÂ· Go Correct Misstroke - uses correction mode, but does not scan to an\nuntranslate; the cursor must already be on the word you wish to correct. (To use\nthis, you will need to be able to move the cursor from the steno machine; there\nare realtime editing macros that do this.)\nIn addition, here are some of the entries you will need in KEYMODE.DIX to\neffectively perform globals from the writer:\nÂ· Panic Stroke - escape all dialogs, return to normal translation.\nÂ· Global Job - RT, Global Main - RT, Global Local - RT. Perform the global type\nspecified, return to normal translation.\nÂ· Plus Left Stroke, Plus Right Stroke, Minus Left Stroke, Minus Right Stroke.\nAdds more strokes to the global, allowing you to perform multi-stroke globals.\nÂ· Capitalize Global - RT. Allows you to control the capitalization of a global, by\npressing the Capitalize button on the global dialog .\n31\n331\n328\n331\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1153\nÂ· Type:. There are macros that allow you to type braces, spaces, punctuation\nmarks, and other symbols. You must assign these to steno keystrokes to be able\nto type them into the global dialog from the steno machine.\nVISUALIZERS: G5 - Macros\nG5 - RT Kit\n23.100Working with Realtime Output\nWorking With REALTIME\nOUTPUT\nRELATES TO: Output Formats , Working With\nRealtime , Realtime tab .\nEclipse's realtime output feature allows you to do realtime, and send a realtime\nfeed to one or more recipients. For example, you can send a transcript to a judge's\ncomputer via cable. Captioning is also a form of realtime output; it can also be\nused to display text on marquee devices, or for remote live scoping .\nTo set up realtime output, you must first set up realtime .\nOnce you have basic realtime working, you will first need a means to send the\nrealtime output to the recipient. If you are sending the transcript to the judge and/or\nattorney(s), it is typical to send via a cable connection. You will need to get a second\nCOM port; this can be done via the same techniques given in the section on realtime\nhardware . Acquire a device, install it, and make a note of the COM port number.\nOnce you have an output port, you will select the COM port number, speed,\noutput type, and other options in Output Formats , which can be accessed from\nthe Realtime tab .\nIt it also possible to send realtime output by other means, such as a phone\nmodem (typical for captioning) or a network connection: see Output Formats for\nfurther information.\nVISUALIZERS:\nvD3_Realtime_Setup.mp4\nvD3a_Realtime_Output.mp4\nvD3a_Realtime_Output_Buffer.mp4\nvD3a_Wireless.mp4\n520\n483 487\n666\n527\n483\n484\n520\n487\n520\n1154 Eclipse Help\nvD3b_Bridge.mp4\nvD3b_Bridge_Pro.mp4\nvD3c Bridge Mobile.mp4\nvD5_Remote_Scoping.mp4\nvD6d_Connection Magic Users Dialogue\nvD6_Shared_Editing.mp4\nvD6_Shared_Editing Tips.mp4\nvA8_CART_Window.mp4\nvL4_AccuCAP.mp4\n23.101Working with Saving\nWorking With SAVING\nRELATES TO: Close .\nThere is no explicit \"save\" command for files, because Eclipse\nautomatically saves your work as you go. Closing a text file, note file, or\ndictionary will save it.\nWhen you are editing, Eclipse keeps a log of every change you make,\nand enters in a hidden file called jobname.elg. It updates this file every 5\nseconds, so if there is a power failure, crash or lockup on your computer, you\nwill never lose more than 5 seconds' work. If there has been an unplanned\nshutdown, when you open the job and there's an elg file present, the\nsoftware knows that there are unsaved changes and immediately applies the\ncontents of the .elg file to the document transparently, restoring your most\nrecent edits.\nIf you would like additional protection, you can activate the Timed Auto\nBackup feature on the Edit tab of User Settings . It will do a\ncomplete save according to the auto-backup interval, which you can set for\nbetween 10 and 30 minutes. When it saves the file, it saves it simultaneously\nin jobname.ecl and jobname.ub0 in the backup folder, and deletes the\njobname.elg file, which is re-created when you have been editing for 5\nseconds.\n23.102Working with Translation\nTRANSLATION\n945\n308 306\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1155\nThe term \"translation\" refers to the process of producing a transcript from steno.\nThere are two ways to perform a translation:\n1.

Zipping files\nmakes them smaller and easier to transfer.\nIf you have zipped a file, or received a .ZIP file from someone else, it\nmust be unzipped before it can be worked with in Eclipse.\nYou can zip or unzip files in the file manager . When you do this,\nthey will always be unzipped in the same folder. So if you want to work with\nthe contents of a zip file you received from someone else, place the ZIP file in\nyour Jobs folder, and unzip it there.\nYou may also work with ZIP files outside of Eclipse. (In fact, ZIP is a\nworldwide computing standard.) If you try to unzip a file in Windows\nExplorer, or anywhere else, the WinZip program will run. More advanced\nactions, such as zipping entire folders or zipping across multiple floppy disks,\ncan be done from with WinZip. WinZip has its own help system.\nAbout Audio Files\nDo not zip audio files. They are already compressed, and zipping them\nwill not help. In fact, it is a good idea to add WAV to the list of file types\nthat are excluded from a ZIP .\nAny other Eclipse file type may be zipped.\nWinZip is a registered trademark of WinZip International LLC.\n269 224\n483\n548 556 86\n312\n339\n319\n356\n677\n680\n682\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1157\n23.104Writers - Customization\nWriters\nRELATES TO: User settings/Input tab .\nAvailable writers\nUnder User settings/Input/Writer, a drop-down list lets you select from\namong all the available writers:\n226\n1158 Eclipse Help\nCustomizable Extended Keyboards\nThe Passport, the Gemini/Infinity series, and the Treal keyboards all have more\nkeys than normal, and going to User settings/Input/Keyboard, selecting your\nkeyboard, and \"Extended keyboard,\" and clicking the Key map button allows you to\nassign each key to ANY of the existing steno characters.\nThe sample physical keyboard you see in the dialog below is a graphic\nrepresentation of your actual keyboard. Note that it will look very different depending\non whether you have a Passport, Gemini or Treal. The emulator will show you the way\nthe keyboard will currently behave.\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1159\nAbove the keyboard graphic is a dialog that allows you to map any physical key\non the keyboard to a steno character. Press the Physical key button, which will show a\nsmaller steno machine, then select the key you wish to change. That will change the\ntext on the button. You can then select any of the available steno characters from the\nbuttons below.\nBy default, each key on the extended keyboards is a separate, distinct steno\ncharacter. The S key on a Passport, for example, is split into Z and S. The asterisk is\nsplit into * and ~. On a Gemini, there are TWO sets of central keys, meaning that the\nleft is divided into $ and % and the right into * and ~.\nSo, for example, if you wanted to keep the individual keys in all cases except that\nyou wanted to keep both the left-side keys as S, you could simply select the physical\nZ key and assign it to the S steno character. Note that when you do that, the\nkeyboard emulator below the dialog will now show S for both the upper and lower\nkeys on the left side.\nThis dialog has shortcuts for the most common keys that users might want to\nlink, such as the Z/S or the */~($/%). For Gemini and Treal keyboards, you may also\nwant to link the number bar keys together to simulate a single number bar rather\nthan having them behave as individual number keys.\nThere is a checkbox where you can select whether the number bar key changes\nthe rest of the keyboard or not. Usually, with the Gemini or Treal, you would select\nthis option only if you were linking the number keys together as a single number.\n1160 Eclipse Help\nThis system gives you total control over how you take advantage of your\nextended keyboard. Perhaps you want to try the Passport with a split */~ key but\nkeep the S linked? No problem. You want to try the individual number keys on a\nGemini, but you want to link both the S/Z and the */~? Again, no problem. This\nsystem can support any possible arrangement and combination of extended keys. You\ncan even reassign the letter keys! As a really off-the-wall example, you might have\nthe extra row of keys on a Treal and want to shift all of your left-side letters over by\none key so that instead of ^ and + on the left, you start with Z/S (or S/S) and then\nput the ^ + in the middle. It's entirely up to you.\nNote: Once you have converted your existing standard dictionary over to\nextended format (which you can do by exporting it to RTF, changing to an extended\nkeyboard under the input options, then re-importing it to a new dictionary from RTF)\nthen you can try any combinations you like without affecting your dictionary.\nOnce you have converted your dictionary to extended format, it won't look any\ndifferent. But depending on how you've configured your extended keyboard, you\nmight have to hit entries differently. If you are using the split */~, any existing\ndictionary entry that contains an * has to be hit with the upper key. If you want to hit\nit with the lower key, you have to change the entry.\nYou can have different entries for the upper and lower, and these changes can be\nmade gradually. Likewise, if you wish to try the split S at some point in the future,\nyou can start out with it linked and then change it later without having to convert\nyour dictionary again.\nA few writers have characteristics requiring additional explanation:\nProCAT Stylus\nProCAT's Stylus writer creates note files in Stenograph format on their RAM card.\nYou can read those files without having to change your writer selection.\nThe Stylus also does audio recording and creates RTF notes and text files that\ncan be imported into Eclipse. The audio synchronization will work with the note\nreading or with the RTF import.\nThe ProCAT Stylus produces RTF text files based on the translator on the writer.\nThese files contain both absolute and relative timecodes. Eclipse imports these\nrelative timecodes.\nIf a user has a Stylus and wishes to read the notes and retranslate in Eclipse, one\noption is to take the RTF from the Stylus, even though it's a job RTF, and import that\nRTF into a note file. The result will be a note file that has correct absolute and relative\ntimecodes and will synchronize perfectly with the WAV file copied from the Stylus.\nProCAT Expression\nProCAT's Expression writer emulates a Diamante with its note file format, so\nusing the \"read notes\" function takes that into account and reads the notes in\nDiamante format.\nNone\nAppendix: Alphabetical List of Additional Pages 1161\nThe writer choice of \"None\" gives you the ability to start a realtime translation\nsession with no writer attached at all. You can then start a realtime job in order to\nsend script lines to an output device, for example, for the hearing impaired for open\nor closed captioning. This will also work on an edit station.\nMichela MIDI and Michela MIDI 2\nThere are two MIDI Michela writers on the list. The second one uses the antistacking\nalgorithm, and the original one still waits for all keys to be lifted before\nregistering a stroke.\nDiamante/Mira/Fusion\nThe Mira-style USB realtime interface to the Diamante is functional, but it only\nworks in realtime. To read notes, it is necessary to plug the SD card into the computer\nor into an SD card reader. The new note file format is sufficiently different that the\nUSB interface will require some modifications in order to read the notes over the\ncable.\nDiamante/Mira/Fusion native note file format interface\nIt is not necessary to use the compatibility mode on the Mira or Fusion, nor is it\nnecessary to use the conversion utility for the Diamante notes. Eclipse can directly\nread the new date/time style filenames from the Diamante, Mira and Fusion. This\nincludes the time of day and relative timecodes.\nIMPORTANT: This means that when you have Mira/Fusion/etc. selected in Eclipse\nas your writer, Eclipse is not REQUIRING that the notes be in the newer date/time\nformat. If your Mira/Fusion is still set to have the note files in compatibility mode,\nthey will NOT work with Eclipse V5. The best solution is to set the writer to use the\nnewer file format. However, if you need to read files from the old format the solution\nis simple: Set Eclipse's writer setting to Stentura and it will read the older format files\njust fine.\nDiamante/Mira/Fusion audio sync adjusted to account for auto-pause\nThe timecodes read from the new note files and the jobname.apr files allow\nEclipse to synchronize with the WAV files recorded on the Diamante, Mira and Fusion,\neven if you have the auto-pause feature turned on.\nCase Catalyst / Diamante dictionary import function\nYou can use Tools/Import/Dictionaries/FromCase Catalyst to import the filename.sgdct files\ninto Eclipse. Note that it does not currently convert all of the special characters that can\nappear, but with enough additional information these could be added later. However, it will\nconvert all of the words, names, etc., that do not contain special commands such as new\nparagraphs, etc. Special commands will be converted as raw hexadecimal values such as /x16.\nIf necessary, find/replace functions can be used to substitute the appropriate Eclipse syntax. If\nsufficient examples are sent in to support@eclipsecat.comof what these special characters are\nand what they should look like, the converter can be modified to do those conversions\nautomatically.\n1162 Eclipse Help\nPassport\n\"start from which stroke\" message in Passport\nYou will get the option of hitting first/last/other when starting realtime on a\nPassport (unless you use the instant realtime button.)\nPassport shadows appear on notes display\nAfter reading in a note file from the Passport, you can open the note file in\nEclipse and see the key shadows just as they appear on the Passport display.\nRemember that keys showing in any shade of red or pink are shadows and will not be\nused in the translation.

Then, once DNS\nis installed, configured, trained, and operating properly, you can move on to learning\nabout how it interfaces with Eclipse Vox. With Eclipse Vox Turbo, you will perform\nthese functions from within Eclipse Vox.\nYou will need a different license for either \"Speech\" or \"Turbo Speech.\"\nContact Singularity Software for further information about software requirements.\nThey can also advise you about hardware requirements; voicewriting is far more\nresource-intensive than using a steno machine.\nFor additional documentation, see the Eclipse documentation folder.\nVoisteno\nWhen you speak into the voice engine, your words are sent to Eclipse, and\ntreated as steno. This is called \"voisteno.\" Like machine steno, voisteno will translate\nagainst a dictionary in Eclipse. For example, you might voice the following:\nqmac what is your name qco amac I am king arthur peerco qmac what is your\nquest qco amac I seek the holy grail\nMany of these entries are basic words that require no further processing; others,\nlike qmac, amac, and \"king arthur\" require Eclipse dictionary entries to get them to\nformat correctly. To do this, create entries in your main dictionary, either by\nglobaling or via Add Dictionary Entry (Ctrl+D) .\nIn the above example, you would want to have the following dictionary entries:\n1173\n31\n326 173\nVoicewriting with Eclipse Vox 1165\nThe paragraph would format like this:\nVoicewriters use the same dictionary syntax as machine reporters. However,\nvoicewriters have very small main dictionaries compared to steno reporters, because\nmost words require no further processing. (You don't need a dictionary entry to\nchange the voisteno \"what\" into the word \"what\".)\nFor a more detailed explanation, see Voisteno .\nGlobaling\nVoicewriters perform globals just as steno reporters do, but they serve\nsomething of a different purpose.\nIn voicewriting, there are no untranslates. What you get instead are\nmistranslations; words that the voice engine resolved incorrectly. You will use the\nglobal function in Eclipse to fix mistranslations; this will correct the word in the\ntranscript, and also help the voice engine learn your speaking style.\nTo do this:\n1. Put the cursor on the mistranslated word.\n2. Press Ctrl+G or hyperkey G to global it.\n3. The underlying audio will play. Confirm that the audio represents the word you\nmeant to say. In other words, make sure it doesn't contain a piece of the\npreceding or following word, and that the entire sound of the word is present. If\nit isn't, create a multi-stroke global that contains an entire clean sound of an\nentire phrase. If you need to hear the audio again, press Ctrl+P.\n958\n1169\n326\n326\n327\n1166 Eclipse Help\n4. Type what you meant to say.

Use Eclipse dictionary syntax only when creating Main dictionary entries,\nas explained above.\n5. Press Enter, or Ctrl+L to perform a Local global . Most of your globals as a\nvoicewriter will be Local globals, since their purpose is to correct a\nmistranslation in that location only. (You might want to confirm that Dictionary\nand Capped are both set to \"Local\" on the Edit tab .)\nWhenever you perform a local global in voicewriting, the global is added to the\nCorrections List. The information can then be sent to voice engine via Apply\nCorrections .\nVoicewriters can do other types of globals:\nÂ· Main (Ctrl+M): Use this global type when the word translated correctly, but you\nwant to change its formatting in the main dictionary. For example, you would\nglobal qmac as {Q}\nÂ· Job (Ctrl+J) or User (Ctrl+1 through Ctrl+8): Use this global type when the word\ntranslated correctly, but you want to change its formatting in the main dictionary.\nThis is useful for speaker IDs. Job and User dictionaries work the same as they do\nfor machine reporters: see the page on Working With Multiple Dictionaries .\nÂ· Trash (Ctrl+T): Works like a Local global, except that it will replace all instances\nof this mistranslation. Use only when the voice engine makes the same error in\nseveral locations.\nApplying Corrections\nAfter you perform one or more Local globals, they are added to the corrections\nlist. To view the corrections list, select Apply Corrections from the Tools/Voice\nmenu, or press Ctrl+Shift+V:\n331\n958\n328\n310\n1166\n675\n1180\nVoicewriting with Eclipse Vox 1167\nEach item in the list is a Local or Trash global you made. To send a correction to\nthe speech engine, select it, and then click Apply. It may take a moment to process.\nIf you don't want to apply a correction, select it and then click Delete. (You may\nnot want to apply a correction if you misspoke the word, because the voice engine will\nuse that sound when attempting to resolve your voice in the future.)\nWhen making local globals, it is a good idea to delete unwanted corrections right\nafter you make them. If you make a local global but don't want to send it to the voice\nengine, just open the Corrections List and delete the unwanted item. You may then\nclose the Corrections List; all other corrections will remain there, and can be applied\nlater. If you delete unwanted corrections as you make them, when you finish the job,\nonly wanted corrections will remain in the list. When you finish editing the job, you\nmay then them indiscriminately, without having to ask yourself, \"did I want this one\nor not?\"\nAudio\nVoicewriters do not have paper tape and other fallback methods that machine\nreporters do. For this reason, you will want to make an audio recording of the\ndeposition. It is also wise to have an audio recording that is independent of your\ncomputer, such as a digital recorder.\nAudio recording for voicewriters works the same as it does for machine reporters.\nYou will check Record Audio on the Translate Notes dialog, and a .WAV file will be\ncreated. This can be either a secondary copy of your own voice, or a recording of the\ndeponent's voice. For more information, see Working With Audio .\nThis will give you two separate sound files: the \"voice track\", which is your own\nvoice, and the \"room track\", which is the .WAV file. Use Shift+Alt+J and\nShift+Alt+K to play and stop the voice track; use Alt+J and Alt+K to control\nthe room track.\n269\n649\n1180 1064\n1168 Eclipse Help\nAlso, you need to calibrate your audio levels before each new realtime job. See\nCalibrating Audio Levels For Voicewriting in Appendix G:Eclipse and Speech\nRecognition, in the Eclipse Users Manual, found in the Eclipse documentation\nfolder for a fuller discussion of audio calibration.\n1. Error messages\nIf any function fails, Eclipse Vox will report an error saying which function was\nattempted and the error code it produced. The error will have the function description\n(such as âplayâ) and a numeric error code. If one of these appears, make a note of it\nand report it directly to the programmer at Advantage Software.\nAnalyze Documents\nThe Tools/Analyze documents feature works differently for steno writers and for\nvoice writers.\nFor a detailed description of how its uses for steno writers, see Working with\nDictionaries: Analyze documents\nIn Eclipse Vox, this feature is used to train the voice engine by analyzing existing\ntranscripts.

We call this âvoistenoâ as an abbreviation of\nâvoiceâ and âsteno.â By using this method, voicewriters are given full access\nto all of the features that steno machine reporters have access to.\nWhen you use a normal word processing program, the text goes\nstraight from the speech program directly into the text of the document:\nDragon Naturally Speaking --> Text document\nHowever, when you use Eclipse Vox, it processes the speech, dividing it\ninto individual words with timecodes, and then feeding the voisteno through\nits translator, allowing an extra layer of intelligent processing and command\ncapability. The translator then inserts the text into the document.\nDragon Naturally Speaking--> Eclipse Vox --> Text document\nFor that reason, you should avoid using any special features in the\nspeech engine itself. For example, there are methods in Naturally Speaking\nfor issuing commands, performing capitalization, changing text attributes,\netc. Since Eclipse Voxâs translator is capable of performing these functions, it\nis better to allow the Eclipse Vox translator to do them so that Eclipse Vox\nhas full and complete control and a complete understanding of what\nprocesses are being performed.\n1170 Eclipse Help\nNote that ordinary words need no additional processing. A steno\nmachine writer needs to enter dictionary entries for every stroke, but a\nvoicewriter only needs to create dictionary entries for words that require\nspecial processing. Example:\nHere is an example of a short piece of text and several different ways it\ncan be handled:\nQ This is Exhibit 4, a contract; is that correct?\nA Yes, it is.\nNow, here is a rough approximation of what you might say if you were\nwriting directly into a word processor using a speech engine right out of the\nbox.\nNew line capital q tab capital this is exhibit digit\nfour comma a contract semi-colon is that correct question\nmark new line capital a tab capital yes comma it is period\nIf you wanted to streamline this, you could teach the speech engine\nthat the word âqmacâ meant to put in a new line, a capital Q, a tab and to\ncapitalize the next word. You could create shortcuts like this for a lot of the\ntext by teaching the engine new words and phrases.\nHowever, using Eclipse Vox, that is NOT what you want to do. Instead,\njust teach the speech engine a new word (qmac) and train it to know how\nyou say that word.\nThen create a dictionary entry:\nqmac = {Q}\nThe {Q} syntax is Eclipse Voxâs way of representing a question. Note\nthat you can also teach the speech engine {Q} and just put that directly into\nthe engine. However, sometimes the speech engine prefers that the word you\nare teaching it sounds close to the way itâs spelled.\nHere is the way that you could speak that same phrase using Eclipse\nVox:\nqmac this is exhibit four cmac a contract is that\ncorrect\namac yes it is\nNow, in order for that to work, you would have to have the following\ndictionary entries in your Eclipse Vox dictionary, telling the system how to\ntranslate the voisteno on the left into the translation on the right. An\nexplanation appears in brackets after the text:\nqmac = {Q} [a question]\namac = {A} [an answer]\ncmac = {,} [a comma]\nexhibit = \\exhibit\\Exhibit{#N} [if followed by a number, will\npick choice two and force the number to be in digits]\nVoicewriting with Eclipse Vox 1171\nis that correct = {;?}is that correct [insert a soft\nsemicolon before the phrase]\nyes = {,?}yes{,} [insert a soft comma before the word âyesâ and\nan overridable comma afterward]\nNote that for most of the words in that short segment, no dictionary\nentries are necessary.\nThe above examples demonstrate how the speech engine interacts with\nEclipse and how it is different from (or the same as) using a steno machine.\nFor a more detailed discussion of the dictionary entries, see the relevant\nsections of the Eclipse manual, help text and version changes that deal\nspecifically with dictionary entry syntax.\nWith machine steno, missing dictionary entries become âuntranslatesâ\nwhich appear in a different color and are considered an error, even if they\nappear correct using the phonetic steno processing procedures. With speech,\nhowever, there are NO âuntranslatesâ and words that are not in the dictionary\nare simply inserted with no additional processing.\nVoisteno appears in note files and in the steno window on the righthand\nside of text files, just as machine steno does. And like machine steno,\nyou can manipulate the raw voisteno files and retranslate them. Voisteno\nthat appears vertically may be broken up into multiple parts if the word is too\nlong, because there is a limited amount of information that can be contained\nin a single âsteno strokeâ in this software.\nFor example, if you said the following:\nthis is representing a word\nIt would show up as follows in the steno window and in the note file:\nthis\nis\nrepresent+\ning\na\nword\nThe long words are broken up, which has no bearing on the final\ntranslation. Itâs simply a way for the voisteno manager to handle large words.\nNormally, the words are broken up at spaces.\nThere are many places in the program where you will be asked to enter\na steno stroke by hand (Edit menu | Add dictionary entry, for example.) For\nmachine writers, a dialog will appear that will show a virtual steno keyboard\nand allow you to type the strokes. For voicewriters, it displays a box for you\nto type in the original text. Simply type the original speech engine words\nseparated by spaces.\n1172 Eclipse Help\nHere are some ideas about how you can use voisteno to your\nadvantage.\nEclipse Vox is designed to allow you to very quickly create dictionary\nentries, even on the fly, to change or modify your translation. Training new\nwords in a speech engine takes longer and requires you to speak the words\ninto the engine, which you may not have an opportunity to do.\nFor some types of entries, you may want to create special token words\nthat you teach the speech engine to produce, such as âbizâ or âspeeâ and\ndefine them in your main and job dictionary like so.\nMachine writers often use âbriefsâ or âtokensâ similar to these:\nMain dictionary:\nspee one = {S:SPEAKER1}\nspee two = {S:SPEAKER2}\nflodip = Florida Department of Transportation\nJob dictionary for case number 123:\nspee one = {S:MR. SMITH}\nspee two = {S:MR. JONES}\nbiz one = Advantage Software\nbiz two = Walters Manufacturing Company\nJob dictionary:\nspee one = {S:MR. GREENE}\nspee two = {S:MR. BROWN}\nbiz one = Hopkins Pharmaceuticals\n{DELETE}in voicewriting\nYou can put {DELETE} in your speech dictionary and it will remove the\nprevious word, even if it is made up of multiple voisteno strokes, which will\nhappen automatically if the word is too long to fit in one stroke.\nVoicewriting with Eclipse Vox 1173\nA final note about voisteno: The dictionaries may appear to be in an\nunusual order. Thatâs perfectly normal. Dictionaries are sorted in steno order,\nwhich makes searching for entries easier for the computer. The voisteno is\ncompressed into a complex binary code, which will mean that the order of\nentries will not make sense, since itâs not alphabetical.\nHowever, you can still search for entries, and you can go directly to a\nparticular entry by using the âgo toâ command in the dictionary. Since\nvoicewriter dictionaries will tend to be much, much smaller than machine\nwriter dictionaries, this shouldnât pose much of a problem.\n25.2 Create and set up a user: The Speech Options Dialog\nCreate and set up a User in Eclipse for\nVoicewriting\nTo set up Eclipse for voicewriting, you will make changes on several of\nthe tabs in User settings.\nUser settings/User\nFirst, create a new user for yourself via the Create new user button on\nthe User tab . Then import the settings file called SPEECH.SET. This\nfile is located in the Eclipse folder; in a default installation, this would be C:\n\\Program Files\\Advantage Software\\Eclipse. Importing this SET file will give\nyou a default speech setup.\nUser settings/Input\nGo to the Input tab , and select Speech in both the Writer and\nKeyboard layout fields.\nIf you click the Setup button to the right of Realtime from..., it will\nopen the Speech options dialog, where you can set your preferences for\nhow Dragon sends data to Eclipse.\n101 103\n226\n1174 Eclipse Help\nFollow behind recognition __ words\nThe default value for this is one word. You can set this larger if you\nwant to give Dragon more opportunity to work with the audio before sending\nin the results. It is best not to set this at zero. If you do, it will frequently\nhave to delete the last word when it re-thinks the recognition.\nThe lower you set the \"follow\" value, the faster the results will display,\nbut the more likely that something will come up wrong and have to be\ndeleted and re-written. For captioners, 2 is a good setting choice.\nAllow deletion and rewriting __ words\nThe default for this is five words. The higher you set the \"delete\" value,\nthe farther back that Eclipse can go to correct a misrecognition. Keep in\nmind, though, that Dragon will go way back in the text to change something\nincredibly minor (and that may not even be right.) If you set it to 100, for\nexample, then there will probably be times when Dragon will delete the last\n100 words and rewrite them just to change âthatâ to âitâ or something\nequally trivial.\nIMPORTANT: If you do closed captioning, it is strongly recommended\nthat you set this to no more than TWO, because captioners should typically\nhave the \"allow backspaces\" turned off. If the User\nsettings/Realtime/Output formats/Flush Word Delay is set to 2000 or\nso, then the deletion will be able to delete at least the last word and often\nthe word before it, so you never need to set this value lower than one.\nVoicewriting with Eclipse Vox 1175\nKey/voice duplex offset\nWhen doing voicewriting, the \"force translation\" feature will\nintentionally delay forcing the translation so that it enters the translation\nstream at the same time that the words word said, rather than forcing it into\nthe stream immediately. This allows you to create one-key macros such as Q\nto force-tran {Q}. By creating macros to do paragraphing and punctuation,\nyou may be able to eliminate having to say qmack, amack, quex, cah, perk,\nspee-one, etc., for all of the paragraph and punctuation. Instead, you can\nspeak naturally and use keystrokes for everything not spoken.The Key/voice\nduplex offset setting (which is in milliseconds) allows you to adjust the\noffset forward or backward. If the keyboarding is consistently appearing too\nsoon, increase the value. If it's appearing too late, decrease it.\nFlush automatically on pause:\nSends the ^ voisteno stroke (which should be defined as {FLUSH} in\nyour main dictionary) whenever you stop speaking and Dragon sends out the\nfinal recognition results. If you have that turned off, it still sends the results,\nbut doesn't send the ^ stroke. Captioners and CART providers should have\nthis option on. Reporters often turn it off, because the ^ can get in the way\nof globaling.\nDefer all corrections:\nWith Defer all corrections OFF, when you make a correction with the\nmicrophone turned off, that correction will be sent to Dragon immediately so\nthat you don't have to do âapply correctionsâ later. (Corrections made while\nthe microphone is on will always be deferred, no matter what.)\nTrain new words automatically:\nIf you do a correction and Dragon doesn't already know the word you're\ncorrecting, this option will cause Dragon to add the word and then will ask\nyou to train it by speaking it into a âtrain wordâ dialog box. If you have this\noff, then the correction will be ignored if it contains unknown words. Most\nusers should leave this on.\nDisable number formatting\nThis option automatically disables the number formatting features in\nDNS entirely, meaning that Eclipse will get the raw number words instead of\nconverted numbers. This eliminates the need to disable it in the DNS\nsettings. This option doesn't work in older versions of DNS.\nUse dictation mode\nThis option sets DNS to dictation mode automatically whenever a\nsession is started, eliminating the need to set dictation mode manually each\ntime. Note that this only works with the professional version of DNS.\n1176 Eclipse Help\nUse realtime timecodes\nWhen you turn on this option, Eclipse will read the timecodes in\nrealtime directly from Dragon Naturally Speaking for each word. When used\nwith Dragon Turbo, it is recommended because it provides more accurate\ntimecodes for the correction and speech playback features, and there is no\neffect on performance. When used with a retail version of Dragon, it can slow\ndown the drop rate, so you may wish to turn it off if realtime speed is more\nimportant than accurate playback or corrections.\nStart with microphone on\nIf you prefer to start your speech sessions with the microphone turned\noff, uncheck this box.\nOther settings on the Input tab\nOne difference between using Dragon in Eclipse Vox and other\nprograms is that the text appears in Eclipse one word at a time, and because\nof that the âresults boxâ which shows the text coming up in a box as you\nspeak is disabled since it's not necessary.\nIf Dragon changes its mind about a previously sent recognition, it will\ntell Eclipse and Eclipse will delete back to the word that needs to be changed\nand re-output the results.\nIn order to make this work, you MUST have the User\nsettings/Input/Delete stroke set to * (as voisteno) and you MUST ALSO\nhave * = {DELETE} in your voisteno main dictionary.\nAlso, when the user hesitates while speaking and Eclipse gets the event\nmessage from Dragon that sends the final recognition results, and you can be\nconfident that the system will not have to do any more corrections, Eclipse\nsends a new piece of symbolic voisteno, the ^ stroke. Define that in your\nmain dictionary as the {FLUSH} stroke and it will flush all translation buffers,\nincluding sending the results to the closed captioning encoder immediately.\nSo these three things MUST be done in order for this to work properly:\nSet User settings/Input/Delete stroke to *\nAdd * = {DELETE} to your main dictionary\nAdd ^ = {FLUSH} to your main dictionary\nVoicewriting with Eclipse Vox 1177\nUser settings/Edit\n.\nUnder the Globaling settings group, it is recommended that you set\nthe default Dictionary (and Capped dictionary) to âLocal.â That will ensure\nthat most of your corrections will only apply to the current spot in the\ndocument and not the whole document.\nThis is because most of the time, you will be correcting things that the\nengine misrecognized. For example, you said âhe is in townâ and it dictated\nâhe isnât down.â You will probably only want to change it only that one time.\nThe other options will make the change for ALL of the occurrences of the\noriginal voisteno in a job, which is normal operation for a machine writer, but\nshould be the exception for a voicewriter.\nSpeech auto-play\nThis option mimics a similar feature in the speech engine's own\napplications. The globaling procedure can automatically play the speech\naudio for the text you have highlighted.\nTurn on Speech Auto-play to activate this feature. It will play the\nspeech audio automatically each time you start a global provided that the\nmicrophone is not on (you cannot play back and dictate at the same time.)\nIt will replay the audio every time you increase or decrease the number\nof words being selected using the Up/Down or Ctrl+Up/Ctrl+Down arrows.\nCreate a User in the Voice Engine\n1178 Eclipse Help\nWhenever you run a speech function, Eclipse Vox will automatically\nopen the Dragon Naturally Speaking engine if necessary. If you have a user,\nyou can select it. If you don't, it will make you create and train a new user\nbefore you can continue.\nBefore you can do any voicewriting, you must first create and train a\nuser in Dragon Naturally Speaking. This can be done in the voice engine\nitself; you can also access this voice engine function via the Train Voice\ncommand in Eclipse.\n25.3 Tools/Voice\nTools/Voice menu\nRELATES TO: Voicewriting with Eclipse Vox .\nThe Tools/Voice menu contains features that apply to voicewriting.\n1180\n1164\nVoicewriting with Eclipse Vox 1179\nSetup\nTakes you to the Dragon Naturally Speaking options dialog.\nAudio\nOpens a dialog in your voice engine where you can calibrate audio levels.

It does not have to be a voice transcript; it could\neven have been created by someone else. However, you must create the\nASCII file a certain way:\n1. Open the .ECL file .\n2. Select File/Export .\n3. Under Save As Type, select Raw Text ASCII.\n4. Select a different filename or folder for this file. (If you donât, it may\noverwrite the existing ASCII file.) It is good practice to add the words\n\"for analysis\" to the end of the filename, so you know this file was\ndesigned for the Analyze Documents feature.\n5. It will ask which paragraph types you wish to include in the export, and\nwill default to the testimony paragraphs, such as Q, A and Colloquy,\nand will omit Fixed lines and style paragraphs. You can select or deselect\nany paragraphs to be included and these selections will be\nremembered for future exports.\n6. Click OK.\nYou don't want to create an ASCII file with the standard Output to\nASCII command, because it will include things like line/page numbers,\nand headers/footers that will confuse the voice engine. Also, you should only\nanalyze documents that have been edited. Analyzing a document with\nunresolved errors will produce bad results.\nWhen you are using the SpeechText (SpeechText.dix) dictionary, it reprocesses\nitems like question paragraphs back into voisteno such as \"qmak\"\nso that the analyze documents function knows what voisteno command word\nwould go in that location. It also strips out all carriage returns so that the\nDragon Naturally Speaking program doesn't assume that you are going to\nsay \"new paragraph\" in that location.\nFor example, if you had the following in your SpeechText.dix file:\nqmac = {Q}\namac = {A}\n672\n86\n966\n622\n1188 Eclipse Help\npierco = {.}\ncah = {,}\nAnd you converted the following .ecl file into a raw text file for analysis:\nQ. What is your name?\nA. Smith. John Smith.\nQ. Okay, and where do you work?\nA. I don't.\nIt would convert to the following:\nqmac What is your name?\namac Smith pierco John Smith.\nqmac Okay cah and where do you work?\namac I don't.\nYou must have the special SpeechText.dix file because the software\ncan't do those replacements based on your main Eclipse Vox dictionary which\nmay contain multiple entries that create the same result. For example, your\nmain Eclipse Vox dictionary might contain the following:\namac = {A}\na Mack = {A}\nhay mat = {A}\nAnd when the raw text exporter saw an answer it would have no way of\nknowing which entry to turn it into. One method you can use to create the\nSpeechText.dix file, however, is to mark all of your primary entries in the\nmain dictionary and write them out to a SpeechText.dix file.\nThis change relies solely on the text and formatting information in the\nfully edited .ecl file itself, not on the original voisteno that you spoke, so it is\ncapable of recognizing the context of what you meant to say even if you had\nto do a lot of editing.\nOne way you could kick-start your recognition quickly would be to\nprepare your SpeechText.dix file and then get .ecl files containing a few\nthousand pages of transcript borrowed from an Eclipse colleague, even a\nmachine writer, and make raw text files out of them. Run those through the\nanalyze documents function and the speech engine will learn a lot about your\nvocabulary and context without your having to speak thousands of pages of\npractice.\nNote: if you are using the Raw Text export to actually export raw text\nfor production purposes, the software will look for the SpeechText dictionary,\nand if it's not there, will output the Raw Text exactly as a steno output\nwould, with all linefeeds intact. If the SpeechText dictionary is there, it will\nperform the extra processing.\nVoicewriting with Eclipse Vox 1189\nSelecting Tools/Analyze will take you to a dialog in your voice engine.\nIn Dragon Naturally Speaking, here are the steps you will follow:\n1. When the Add Words from Documents dialog opens, choose \"Find\nunknown words\" and/or \"Adapt to writing style\" and click Next. Yes.\n2. Add Documents or Folders to the Document list, then click Next.\n1190 Eclipse Help\n3. Dragon will then Process all the documents listed, and prepare a list of\nnew words. When it says \"Document analysis complete. Click Next to\ncontinue\" click Next.\n4. You will be asked to \"Please wait\" while it is \"Analyzing word list.\"\n5. The \"Add words to vocabulary\" dialog opens. Words are listed in order of\nfrequency of occurrence. Check the words you want to add. You can also\nclick \"edit\" to open the Edit Word dialog.\nVoicewriting with Eclipse Vox 1191\n6. Click Next. The \"Train words\" dialog opens. Choose the words you want to\ntrain and click Next.\n7. The \"Adapt to Writing Style\" window opens - \"Adapting speech files based\non new document writing style.\"\n8. Wait until you see the message \"Adaptation of your writing style\ncompleted successfully\". Click Next.\n9. You will get a summary showing the number of new words, the number of\nwords added to your vocabulary, and the message \"Adaptation of your\nwriting style completed successfully.\"\n10.Click Finish to close the \"Analyze documents\" wizard.\n1. Complex constructions in SpeechText.dix\nThere's a subtle problem with the SpeechText.dix, in that it tries to\nfigure out what the ideal original voisteno would be for a particular sequence\nof text, based on entries in the dictionary.\nSometimes, that's easy. If you have defairs = Department of Interntal\nAffairs in your SpeechText.dix, and it sees \"Department of Internal Affairs\" in\nyour document (whether you typed it, wrote it out the long way, or\nwhatever) it will turn it to \"defairs\" in the raw jobname.txt file that you're\nusing for Dragon food. Easy.\nOther combinations containing number triggers like volume = Vol.{#R}\nor paragraphs like khaki = {A}yes{Q} are MUCH harder to reverse engineer\nfrom the text.\n1192 Eclipse Help\nIn order to address every possible combination of thingsl like this,\nspeech users with advanced shorthand (shortvoice?) can now add \"fixers\" to\ntheir SpeechText.dix that is a catch-all for any possible combination of things\n(number triggers, paragraphs, conflicts, whatever) that cause the resulting\noutput not to correctly interpret a sequence as the original voisteno shortcut\nand instead write it out as the long-form individual strokes.\nThe catchall is this: Use an exclamation point to indicate retroactive\nbriefs to spell out the shortcut. You can make entries such as\nkakapo = !kak okay peerko\nThat means if the software sees \"kak okay peerko\" in the voisteno it's\nabout to send to the jobname.txt file, it will change it to kakapo (because\nyou have a kakapo = {Q}okay{.} dictionary entry and the speechtext parser\ndidn't figure out that particular combination of things in reverse from the text\nin the document.)\n25.3.7 Tools/Voice/Train new Word\nTools/Voice menu/Train\nnew word\nRELATES TO: Voicewriting with Eclipse\nVox .\nTrain New Word\nThis opens a dialog to record one new word.\nYou spell or type the word to add, select \"I want to train the\npronunciation of this word,\" hit the Add button, Click Go and say the word.\nClick Done.

For\nexample, if you tell the microphone to âsleepâ using the / key, it will\ncontinue to pick up your voice.\nÂ· You can turn the speech input microphone on or off when viewing a\ndictionary or working in a transcript other than the one currently\nbeing transcribed.\n25.4 Calibrating Audio Levels For Voicewriting\nCalibrating Audio Levels For Voicewriting\nAs a voicewriter, you should take the following steps to calibrate your\naudio levels each time you arrive at a voicewriting job. Conditions can change\nfrom day to day. Subtle factors such as the acoustics of the room you are in;\nyour location in the room; the angle of your mask or microphone; and even\nthe humidity can affect your recognition rate. Thus it is good practice to go\nthrough the following steps each day before you begin a voicewriting job,\nmuch as you would âwhite balanceâ a digital camera or camcorder before use.\nCalibrating Ambient Audio\nIt is good practice for voicewriters to make a secondary audio file,\neither by recording the ambient sound in the room, or by making a backup\nrecording of their own voice. In Eclipse Vox, this is be done using the Record\nAudio feature. (You should also have an audio backup that is independent of\nyour computer, such as a tape recorder or electronic recording device.) The\nfollowing steps will insure that your levels for recording ambient sound are\ncorrect:\n1. If your USB audio device isnât plugged in, plug it in now. Plugging in\nthe device may cause Windows to make changes to your audio\npreferences; thus, if you go through the following steps and then plug\nin your USB audio device, your changes may be undone.\n2. Click Start/Control Panel/Sound (or Sounds and Audio Devices).\nNote: This set of directions is for Windows XP. In older versions of\nWindows, the path is Start/Settings/Control Panel/Sounds and\nMultimedia. Your tabs and dialog choices will vary, depending on your\nversion of Windows.\n3. Click the appropriate tab. In XP, it is the Audio tab. The Sounds And\nMultimedia (Audio Devices Properties) dialog will appear. In\nWindows 7, select Recording.\n4. For Sound Recording, set the Preferred Device to your sound card. The\ntext will vary, but you will have two choices: your sound card and your\nUSB device. Select the sound card. Set the volume:\n(XP) Click the Volume button that appears under the Sound\nRecording drop-down list. Confirm that the microphone is selected, the\n1196 Eclipse Help\nother items are not selected and that the microphone slider is at an\nappropriate level (the default is the maximum).\n(Windows 7) On the Recording tab, select Microphone, and\nclick the Properties button. Select the Levels tab, and adjust the\nMicrophone (volume) slider.\n5. For Sound Playback, you have a choice. If you select your sound card,\nthe ambient audio will playback through the computerâs speakers or the\nheadphone jack. If you select the USB audio device, the ambient audio\ncan be heard through the headset of the USB Device. Choose how you\nwant to hear the ambient audio during the proceedings (i.e., for\nreadbacks). Set the Playback volume:\n(XP) Click the Volume button that appears under Sound\nPlayback drop-down list. Confirm that the microphone is muted, and\nthat the Wave and Volume Control sliders are at an appropriate level.\nVolume Control (at the far left) is the master sound slider for your\ncomputer; the Wave slider affects the volume of the wave file only.\nConfirm that Use Only Preferred Devices is unchecked.\n(Windows 7) On the Playback tab, select Internal\nspeaker/headphone. Click the Properties button, and on the Levels\ntab, use the slider to set the Main Volume.\n6. Click OK.\nCalibrating Headset/mask Audio\nYou will need to calibrate the audio levels for your input device.\nTo do this:\n1. In Eclipse Vox, go to Tools/Voice/Audio or click the Vox Audio\ntoolbar button.\n2. The Audio Setup Wizard will appear.\nVoicewriting with Eclipse Vox 1197\n3. You will be asked to adjust the microphone position, and level:\n4. Click Next, and on the next screen, click Start Volume Check, and\nthen read the paragraph you are offered. Continue reading until you\nhear the tone. Repeat the paragraph if necessary.\n5. When finished, click Next and on the next screen, click Start Quality\nCheck, and then read the paragraph. Continue reading until you hear\nthe tone. Repeat the paragraph if necessary. Afterwards, you can click\nthe Play button to hear the recording of your speech. Click Finish to\nexit the Wizard.\n25.5 Voicewriting: Translation\nStarting a session\nOnce you have set everything up properly, you start a dictation session\nexactly as you would start a realtime session with a steno machine. You can\nuse the Production/Translate function or the Instant realtime function.\nThe first time you open the speech engine, you will get a window asking\nyou to select which speech user profile you wish to use. The engine is\ncapable of keeping track of multiple profiles for different users with different\nvoices or for different equipment such as an open microphone vs. a mask.\nOnce you start realtime translation, you will be able to speak and\nEclipse Vox will translate the data into the file just as if you were writing it\nwith a steno machine.\n1198 Eclipse Help\nYou can use the speech audio vu meter in the realtime stats window\nunder âaudio 2â to monitor your input. Normally, Audio 1 is the main channel\nand Audio 2 is the second channel when recording in stereo (which almost\nnobody does.) If you're using Speech, the Audio 2 bar on the realtime\nstatistics will show you the level of your speech audio being entered into the\nmask or the open microphone.\nForce Translation Feature\nThe âForce translationâ function can seamlessly interleave voice and\ncomputer keyboard input. If you type a piece of voisteno into the âforce\ntranslationâ function (a single word with no braces) then it will be added to\nthe translation buffer rather than added to the document immediately.\nThe Tools/Realtime/Force translation function can be used to insert\na translation into the document from the computer keyboard. This has been\nused by machine reporters for macros, but has also been used by speech\nusers to insert translations from the computer keyboard.\nThe main drawback of this feature is that it inserts the translation\nimmediately when the function is executed, which means that you have to\nstop speaking and wait for the final recognition results before using it or it\nwill insert the translation too early.\nEclipse Vox detects when you're using speech, and if the text that you\ntype into the \"force translation\" box contains no braces (indicating that it's\nvoisteno and not a dictionary command), then it will be pushed into Eclipse's\nrecognition engine interface rather than being sent directly to the translator.\nEclipse then interleaves it with the incoming voisteno based on the\ntimecodes being received from Dragon. In other words, you can seamlessly\nintegrate keyboarding with voice with no pausing.\nKeep in mind that this feature uses voisteno, not text, so the best way\nto use it is to make macros for each voisteno stroke that you want to be able\nto write from the keyboard during dictation. For example, here are the\ncontents of such a macro:\nCmd:Force tran\nQ\nM\nA\nC\n[enter]\nFor example, you could create four macros to force the translation of\nqmac, amac, peerk and comak and define them in the main dictionary as\n{Q} {A} {.} and {,}. Assign those to the Hyperkeys [Q] [A] [.] and [,] and\nyou could easily insert them into the translation with one easy-to-remember\nkeystroke.\nVoicewriting with Eclipse Vox 1199\nThis can be used for any number of things, such as specialized\nvocabulary, speaker names, all manner of paragraphing and punctuation, and\ninclude files.\n25.6 Voicewriting: Editing\nMost of the editing functions are performed exactly as they would be for\na machine reporter, so refer to the documentation on Editing a Tanscript .\nThere are some differences, however:\nGlobal corrections\nVoicewriters should take care to do as many corrections as possible\nusing the Edit/Global function (Ctrl+G or Hyperkey G) even if they are not\nâglobalâ corrections. This is important, because only corrections made with\nthis function can be applied to the speech engine to make the recognition\nmore accurate in the future. In fact, if you fail to correct a recognition\nmistake, the engine may suffer and become less accurate, assuming that the\nerror was the correct word.\nWhen you make a Global correction, you have several options about\nwhat to do with that correction. By default, corrections should be Local, which\nmeans that they will only be corrected in that one spot and will inform the\nengine that it made a mistake. You can also select Local intentionally by\nhitting Ctrl+L after typing the correction.\nNote: When you make Local replacements those corrections will be\nrecorded permanently and can be applied to the speech engine at a later\ntime. To apply the corrections, select the Tools/Voice/Apply corrections\nfunction.\nThere will be times when you want to take a perfectly good piece of\nvoisteno and make a dictionary entry out of it, turning qmac into {Q}, for\nexample, or turning âthe daily bugleâ to â{i}The Daily Bugle{n}â (turning it\ninto upper case letters and applying italics to it.) By using Ctrl+M, Ctrl+J or\nCtrl+1 through 8, you can tell your global replacement to be placed\npermanently as a dictionary entry in the Main dictionary, the current Job\ndictionary, or one of the eight currently selected user-definable dictionaries.\nThis is a case where the speech engine did exactly the right thing, but you\nwish to have Eclipse Voxâs translator reinterpret it in a way that Eclipse Vox\ncan take further advantage of. In these cases, the correction will NOT be\nrelayed back to the engine, because the engine produced exactly the right\nresult.\n302\n1200 Eclipse Help\nThe final choice, Ctrl+T, is a âtrashâ global and is somewhere in\nbetween. It does NOT make a dictionary entry, because it is only a temporary\nchange. It DOES change it everywhere in the file, and it ALSO relays the\ncorrection back to the engine. This could be used, for example, in a situation\nwhere the speech engine made the same mistake over and over, so you want\nto correct it everywhere, but you want the engine to learn to do it right so\nthat you will not need to create a dictionary entry.\nPlaying Back highlighted text\nPressing Ctrl+P during a global, if you have speech selected, will cause\nthe text you have highlighted to play back, and will cause the Global Magic\nbox to display suggestions from Dragon for the highlighted text. It will play\nback exactly what is highlighted to make sure you're correcting the right\nthing. Sometimes you may need to include an extra word at the beginning or\nthe end in order to have the audio data for the whole word you're trying to\nconnect.\nVoisteno in a global\nNote that when you fix a speech problem, it is possible to global it in\nand type the replacement using voisteno. In fact, it is PREFERABLE to do it\nthis way.\nFor example, if you're dictating an answer and you say âamac yesâ and\nwhat you get is âa mack yesâ you can make a local replace to global âa\nmackâ to âamacâ and what will happen is this:\n1. The âamacâ correction will go to the âapply correctionsâ function for\nthe speech engine to learn what you really said.\n2. The âamacâ will be translated according to the main dictionary into\n{A} before it is applied to the document, so you will get an answer\nparagraph.\nIn other words, all local replacements and trash globals will be fed\nthrough the main dictionary to determine what should be inserted into the\ndocument, so you should ALWAYS do these corrections by typing in what the\noriginal voisteno SHOULD have been, NOT what the dictionary entry will be\nonce it translates correctly the next time.\n25.7 Applying Corrections\nApplying corrections\nAfter an editing session is complete, you will need to apply the\ncorrections to the speech engine. This is done by using the\nTools/Voice/Apply corrections (or Ctrl+Shift+V) function.\nWhen applying corrections to the engine, most corrections will be\napplied with no additional input required. If new words are detected, they\nwill automatically be added to the current vocabulary and you will be asked\nto train them by speaking the word once.\nVoicewriting with Eclipse Vox 1201\nThis function will list all of the corrections that you have made that\nshould be taught to the speech engine. You must use the Apply button to\napply these one at a time. Since the âapplyâ button is the default button, you\ncan usually just hit the [Enter] key.\nThere is also an Apply all button, which you can use to apply all the\ncorrections listed at once.\nNote that when you press âapplyâ it will bring up the speech engineâs\ncorrection dialog box. If you wish to use the text that you originally typed in\nEclipse Vox, you can use Ctrl+V to paste in that text. As a result, most of\nthe corrections will be applied simply by hitting [Enter], Ctrl+V, [Enter].\nThere may be times when you wish to skip a correction. For example,\nthe speech engine may not be tracking to the right words, so you can just\ncancel out of the correction dialog and thatâs perfectly OK. A few skipped\ncorrections wonât hurt anything.\nOther times, you may wish to type something different from what you\noriginally typed in Eclipse Vox. For example, if you said âqmacâ and the\nspeech engine produced âqueue mapâ you may have corrected that to {Q} in\nyour Eclipse Vox document, but you may want to tell the speech engine that\nit should have been âqmac.â This is optional. It is permissible to put Eclipse\nVox dictionary syntax like {Q} into your speech engineâs dictionary if you\nprefer and if the speech engine will accept it.\n25.8 Checking the Audio\nChecking the audio\nEclipse Vox has two methods of crosschecking the audio recording with\nthe text.\nIn the Tools/Multimedia menu, there are functions for playing back\nthe ambient audio recording. If you are running the speech engine through a\nsecondary sound system and you have a room microphone recording the\nsound from the room, these functions can be used to listen to what was\noriginally said.\nIn the Tools/Voice menu, there is a Play function that both plays and\nstops the speech engine audio. When you use this function, it plays back\nwhat you, the voicewriter, originally spoke into your microphone. Note that\nthe pause/resume for the room audio and the vox microphone off/on are\nsynchronized in order to maintain consistent audio synchronization.\nA Word of Caution:\n1202 Eclipse Help\nThe playback, correction, training and other speech engine functions\nCANNOT be executed during a dictation session while you are speaking. The\nspeech engine cannot do two things at once. In other words, if you are\nvoicewriting and you have an assistant scoping as you work, they cannot use\nthe âplayâ or âapply correctionsâ functions as you are voicewriting. Thatâs part\nof the reason that there is a function for applying the corrections later. If you\nattempt to use those functions, a warning message will remind you to turn\noff the microphone first.\n25.9 Session Load/Save functions\nSession Load/Save functions\nThe speech session files will automatically be saved before another one\nis loaded or before a new session is started. It will also save automatically\nwhen closing. The Speech engine is keeping track of when the session is\nmodified so it never saves unnecessarily. The load session function will be\nexecuted automatically only when the system needs speech data, but again,\nnever unnecessarily.\nSo, for example, you could start up your computer, open Eclipse Vox,\nspend all day editing a job and close it down again without the speech\nengine even opening. However, the moment you perform the speech data\nplayback function or tell the system to apply corrections to the engine, it will\nautomatically open the engine, load the appropriate session and perform the\nfunction.\nSaving Speech files\nIn Dragon Naturally Speaking the save speech files will prompt you\nbefore saving the speech files, giving you the option of when to save the\nglobal speech recognition files. There are several situations where you do not\nwant to do so.\nFor example, if you do a dictation and the recognition rate is really bad,\neven though the speech files have been modified you don't want to save\nthem. Instead, you will want to save them AFTER you have corrected the\ndocument.\nHowever, if you program in some new words before starting a\ntranslation, you will want to save you speech files to make sure those new\nwords are saved. For this reason, it's a good idea to program in new words at\nthe beginning of a day BEFORE you start translation. Then, when you start\ntran, it will ask you if you want to save your speech files and you can answer\nâyes.â\nVoicewriting with Eclipse Vox 1203\nIt will also ask when you go to exit the program. If you have done a\ndictation and it's a mess, answer âno.â If you have been editing and\ncorrecting documents and programming in new words, answer âyes.â\nBecause of the subjective nature of this feature, there is really no other way\nto do this other than giving the user the option of when they want to save or\nnot save.\nSaving speech information\nWhen a JobName.ecl document is dictated using speech recognition\nand then closed, the document will save speech information along with the\n.ecl document.\nTwo additional files will appear in the jobs folder: A JobName.wav file\ncontaining the audio and a file named JobName.DRA containing the speech\ndata from the speech engine itself.\nThese files contain information that are intended to allow you to\nperform two critical functions:\n1. To listen to the original speech while editing in order to crosscheck\nwhat was translated.\n2. To apply corrections back to the speech engine.\nWithout these extra files, you will not be able to perform those\nfunctions.\n1204 Eclipse Help\n26 Bridge Mobile for Eclipse Users\nThis section is a Guide to Bridge and Bridge Mobile for Eclipse Users,\nand the user of Connection Magic Local, and Connection Magic Link (for non-\nEclipse users).\nSeveral Visualizers apply to Bridge and Bridge Mobile. They can be found\nin the \"Visualizers - Complete List \" reference page.\n26.1 Overview: Connecting to Bridge and Bridge Mobile\nBridge and Bridge Mobile are realtime viewers, which can be used by attorneys,\njudges -- anyone who needs to connect to a realtime transcription.\nConnection Magic is the data delivery system used to transmit realtime data\nto Bridge 3 and Bridge Mobile users.\nA Bridge Broadcaster is required to send realtime data via Connection Magic to\nBridge 3 and Bridge Mobile users.\nConnection Magic Local (CM Local) provides a way to connect when there is\nno internet available, or you prefer to connect through a Local network.\nConnection Magic Link (CM Link) allows non-Eclipse users, and Eclipse users\non version 5 or earlier to use Connection Magic with Bridge and Bridge Mobile.\nWho Needs What?\nAn Eclipse6+ user needs either:\n914\n1207 1207\n1209\n1210\n1211\nBridge Mobile for Eclipse Users 1205\n-- An Internet connection\nor\n-- A LAN (such as a portable router) and the Connection Magic Local software.\nA non-Eclipse or Eclipse 5- user needs:\n-- An Internet connection and the Connection Magic Link software, provided to\nreporters who purchase a Bridge Broadcaster\nor\n-- A LAN (such as a portable router), the Connection Magic Local software AND\nthe Connection Magic Link software.\nHow to Connect to Bridge Mobile\nNote that Eclipse will attempt to establish two Connection Magic links at the\nsame time. It will connect to the Internet and also to the LAN, if it sees Connection\nMagic Local. In the status bar, you will see âSRVâ for a server connection, âLANâ for a\nLAN connection, and âS+Lâ if it has a connection to both. The Infobar will show\nSRV+LAN. In Eclipse, all you have to do is select Bridge Mobile and âConnection\nMagicâ as the connection type. When you start realtime, Eclipse will start the session\nsimultaneously on both connections, so however the client connects, they'll be able to\nget the data. Bridge will check both the LAN and the Internet to see where sessions\nmight be available, and will allow you to select which one you are going to connect to.\nIf Bridge Mobile is on a LAN and you hit Connect, and there's only one session,\nBridge Mobile will auto-select it and place the cursor in the Password box so and you\ncan just start typing the password.\nAlso, you can re-use the same Bridge session even if you left it. For example, if\nyou are in a position where you have a Bridge session open, and you have some sort\nof issue (You accidentally stop translation. You have to shut down your computer. You\ntake a break and your system powers down. You name it) you can recover from that\nwithout having to start a new session and having to tell all of your clients to close the\ncurrent session and join a new one. You use the exact same session name you used\nbefore and the exact same password that you used before. It will work even if you\nhave to start a new .ecl job name for some reason. (You can append to the old one,\nbut you don't have to.) Eclipse will pick up on the old session and continue it.\nIn fact, when you run Bridge Mobile (or launch the web version) the very first\nthing it will do is check the list of active sessions. If the session that you were last in\nis still on the list, it will just open it and connect to it immediately (using the same\npassword you typed in before.)It reduces the steps to getting back into the realtime\njob to a single button: The Bridge Mobile icon.\nSessions persist\nWhen creating a Connection Magic session of any type, you can supply an\noptional \"Session Name\" which is separate from the \"Document Name.\" The\ndocument name will still be filled in automatically with a suggestion, and will also be\nused as the session name if the session name is left empty.\n1206 Eclipse Help\nIf you supply a session name, that will stay on the server even after the\ndocument has finished. You can use the same session name (and password) for\nsuccessive days, even though the document name changes. The Connection Magic\nstart session dialog will explicitly state that it is the persistent session name, and that\nusing a persistent session name that is different from the document name is entirely\noptional.\nBridge Mobile, by default, will check to see if the previous session still exists,\nand will re-connect to it automatically. If the document name is different, it will\ncreate a new file. That means that connecting on successive days is completely\nautomatic.\nThe same name and password will appear in the dialog the next time you start a\nsession. Remember to clear it or change it if you want a whole new session. A new\ndocument will always be started, so this could be a convenient way to dramatically\nspeed up the connection process for throw-downs on a day-to-day basis.\nNote that these persistent session names could be used for all of the documents\nin a continuing case (\"FL-1234\") or a branded connection for a reporting firm (\"Smith\nReporting A\") or a convenience connection for an individual (\"JTHORNE\") and be\nreused over and over as many times as necessary.\nAlso, because a persistent session sticks around even after the original owner\nhas disconnected, that means that a second provider can join in as an alternate\nprovider by supplying the same name and password to continue. It is not necessary\nfor the second provider to join before the first one disconnects (though it's probably\nstill better to do it that way for the sake of rapid continuity.)\nRefresh commands\nA note on refresh commands: All versions of Bridge and Bridge Mobile support\ninstant refresh, because refresh commands are part of the Bridge protocol. A growing\nnumber of CAT programs (currently StenoCAT, SmartCAT, DigitalCAT) support the\nBridge protocol. While all CAT programs support the traditional CaseView protocol,\nrefresh commands are not part of the CaseView protocol. So if you transmit realtime\nusing the CaseView protocol, you will not get the benefit of Bridge's refresh ability.\nBridge Mobile for Eclipse Users 1207\n26.1.1 Bridge 3\nBridge (version 3):\nÂ· free software that requires installation on a Windows PC\nÂ· works with all CAT software that uses either the Bridge or CaseView\nprotocol\nÂ· can connect through either a serial or a network connection\nÂ· works with Connection Magic (Reporter must have a Bridge Broadcaster\n-- there is no charge to the attorneys etc.)\nÂ· with Connection Magic and a Bridge Broadcaster, the Internet can be used\nfor clients across the world running Bridge on their PCs\nÂ· with Connection Magic Local , the Reporter, using a portable WiFi router,\nsends realtime to anyone connected to that router running Bridge on their\nPCs\nÂ· late connectors get the entire document, and when used with the Bridge\nprotocol, it supports refresh commands\n26.2 Bridge Mobile -- Browser and App (pro and free) versions\nBridge Mobile (app):\nÂ· Available as Free and Pro versions\nÂ· Expands on Bridge features\nÂ· Works with all CAT software - automatically detects CaseView or Bridge\nprotocol\n1209\n1210\n1208 Eclipse Help\nÂ· Non-Eclipse users connect with Connection Magic Link - software\nprovided to reporters who purchase a Bridge Broadcaster.\nÂ· Works on all devices: iPads, iPhones, iPods, Android, Windows tablets,\nPC/Mac/Linux browsers\nÂ· Works over the Internet or with Connection Magic Local using a portable\nWiFi router.\nÂ· Judges and attorneys can make notes, insert marks and issue codes.\nÂ· Includes keyword highlighting and realtime word indexing.\nÂ· For CART clients, provides a minimal display that can be zoomed in for easy\nreading.\nÂ· For legal support teams, can monitor multiple realtime feeds.

Used for Realtime, it replaces the need to have a cable connected\nto your CAT computer with multiple cable split off for client computers.\nConnection Magic can serve multiple types of data, at the same time.\nYou could have a Bridge session with users connected in more than one\nlocation. At the same time, you can send data to attorneys, judges, etc.\nrunning Bridge on their PCs or Bridge Mobile on any device.\nIn brief:\n1. You start a session and set a password, which you give to your\nclients.\n2. Your clients select the file from a list.\n3. Clients type the password to gain entry.\n4. Connection Magic handles the security.\nWho can use Connection Magic?\nReporters running Eclipse version 6 or later who have a keyless license\nand a Bridge Broadcaster can use Connection Magic to send realtime data\nto scopists and proofreaders, and to attorneys and others running Bridge 3 or\nthe Bridge Mobile app. Details of features specific to Eclipse users are in\ncovered in a separate help section .\nIt can also be used by any CAT system that uses the CaseView protocol\nor the Bridge protocol, including earlier versions of Eclipse.\nWhat is the cost to reporters and attorneys?\nReporters pay an annual fee for a Bridge Broadcaster.\nAttorneys and others who want to run the Pro version of the Bridge Mobile\nApp pay a fee either monthly or annually.\nContact Advantage Software for details.\n1227\n1210 Eclipse Help\nWhat if I am using another CAT system?\nReporters using a CAT system that uses either the CaseView or Bridge\nprotocol can use the Connection Magic Link (CM Link) software to send\ndata to Bridge Mobile. They would need to purchase a Bridge Broadcaster.\nWhat if I don't have internet access?\nYou can use Connection Magic Local (CMLocal) , which enables you to\ncreate a server that lets you send data to Bridge or Bridge Mobile using a\nportable wireless router.\n26.3.1 Connection Magic Local\nConnection Magic Local is server software that enables you to use\nConnection Magic when there is no internet available.\nConnection Magic Local (CM Local) uses a wireless router, along\nwith software provided by Advantage Software, to create a Local Area\nNetwork running the same Connection Magic server that is used online by\nAdvantage Software. Being able to run in a non-internet setting is ideal for\ncourthouses where the internet may not be available, or for portable use.\nWhen you want to send your realtime data to clients running Bridge or Bridge\nMobile, but don't have internet access, you can use CMLocal, with a Bridge\nBroadcaster.\nTo set up Connection Magic Local:\n1. Purchase a wireless router and a Bridge Broadcaster from Advantage\nSoftware.\n2. Obtain the CMLocal software from Advantage Software.\n3. Run the program. When the \"Welcome to Connection Magic Setup\"\nscreen appears, click Next.\n4. The next screen let's you \"Choose install location.\" Generally, you\nshould accept the default by clicking Install.\n5. The last screen says \"Connection Magic Local has been installed on your\ncomputer.\" Click Finish.\n6. When the program is finished installing, there will be a Connection\nMagic Local icon on your desktop\n1211\n1210\nBridge Mobile for Eclipse Users 1211\nTo start a session, double click the desktop icon.\nThe Connection Magic Server opens a window, showing that the Server\nhas started.\nYou do not need to do anything but let it run.\nThere is an IP address, but you only need to use this if your client(s)\nwill use an web browser to connect to Bridge Mobile.\nNote that Eclipse will connect to the Internet and also to the LAN, if it\nsees Connection Magic Local. In the status bar, you will see âSRVâ for a\nserver connection, âLANâ for a LAN connection, and âS+Lâ if it has a\nconnection to both. The Infobar will show SRV+LAN. In Eclipse, all you have\nto do is select Bridge Mobile and âConnection Magicâ as the connection type.\nWhen you start realtime, Eclipse will start the session simultaneously on both\nconnections, so however the client connects, they'll be able to get the data.\n26.4 Connection Magic Link - Installation and Use\nIf you are a reporter using a CAT system that uses either the CaseView\nor Bridge protocol, you can use the Connection Magic Link (CM Link)\nsoftware to send data to Bridge Mobile.\n1212 Eclipse Help\nFor example if you are a Stenocat user, you can output in either\nCaseView or Bridge protocol and pick a com port as if you are using cable â\nthe CAT software thinks it is working with a com port, but CM Link allows that\ncom port to be redirected to the Connection Magic system through which you\ncan send your realtime data to Bridge Mobile.\nYou will need to purchase a Bridge Broadcaster.\n26.4.1 CM Link Installation\nInstallation of CM Link:\n1. Purchase the program from Advantage Software and run it. If you saved it\non your desktop, there will be a link to the program:\n2. Double click the link.\n3.

In the Session settings dialog, you can change the Persistent session name, as\nwell as adding a Password and choosing whether or not to make it publicly visible.\nIf you leave Publicly visible checked, the client can select the name from a list of\nall active sessions. The default name for Bridge/Bridge Mobile sessions begins with\nBR-. You may want to change that to make it easier for your client to find the\nsession. Another tool to make it easier for clients to find the session is to use a\nRoom. There are 8 rooms available, and when you select one, and the client looks\nin that room, there will be far fewer sessions listed. Click OK.\n(Note: If you prefer, you can uncheck Publicly visible, and when the client goes\nto connect, they can type in the name of your session, enter the password if there is\none, and click OK in Bridge or the Check mark in Bridge Mobile. Note: both the\nsession name and password are case sensitive.)\nThe \"Require ID\" checkbox in the session creation dialog for Bridge Broadcast\nsessions prevents users from joining Bridge Mobile sessions anonymously even if they\nknow the password. If you check that box, then all viewers must have a validated email\naddress in their Bridge Mobile settings. If they do not, they will not be permitted\nto join the session. Note that a validated e-mail requires the user to enter their e-mail\naddress, receive the validation e-mail, and click on the link in the e-mail to validate\nthat they own that e-mail address. This prevents users from entering invalid e-mail\naddresses.\n4. The Connection Magic dialog opens. You can see the name of the session and a\nlist of users who are connected to the session (Note: when you begin the\ntranslation, you, the \"host\" will be the only user listed).\n5. If you highlight the name of a user in the session and click the Properties button,\nthe Session user info dialog opens.\n1232 Eclipse Help\n7. Clicking the Password button opens a window that reminds you of the\npassword you set for the session.\n8. Clicking the Remove button will kick the selected user out of the session.\n9. The Color, Find, and Make host buttons are used during a shared editing\nsession, and do not apply to Bridge/Bridge Mobile users.\n10.If you close the Connection Magic dialog, the session itself remains open. To reopen\nthe dialog, go to Tools/Connection Magic/View Connections or click\nthe \"Connect\" toolbar icon.\nNote: The connection from Eclipse to Bridge/Bridge Mobile through the\nConnection Magic server tracks of all of the data that has been transmitted. If\nBridge/Bridge Mobile detects that there is text missing, it will request the missing\ntext from the Eclipse side. This means that if a Bridge/Bridge Mobile user hooks up\nlate, or if the connection drops briefly and then automatically reconnects, the Bridge\nuser will still get all of the text that was sent from Eclipse.\n26.5.2.3 Advanced settings\nApply on Pause\nBridge Mobile for Eclipse Users 1233\nUnder User settings/Realtime/Output, there is a \"apply on pause\"\ncheck box right next to \"apply edits.\"\nWhen this is checked, after a very short pause (less than a second,\nusually) any edits you have made to the current paragraph will get\ntransmitted immediately to the Bridge Mobile users.\nNote that this should probably be turned off if you're using a low-baud\nrate solution such as cables or StenoCast. But most people are using Internet\nor LAN, and the speeds are hundreds of times faster, so data transmissions\ncan be sent without delay.\nThis makes the Bridge refresh \"feel\" far more like the Team Editing\nfeature. Essentially, all edits are applied as close to \"immediately\" as makes\nno difference.\nAdvanced hint: The actual amount of time the system will wait before\ndeciding you're done making your edits is the View\nToggles/Infobar/Delay time setting for AutoMagic. It defaults to 500ms\n(half a second) and you can adjust it up or down. If you make it too small, it\nwill start machine-gunning edits in the middle of, say, typing a word. If you\ntype \"Washington\" into the middle of a sentence, that should be sent as one\nedit, not 10! So don't make that number too small.\nBridge output refreshes the last paragraph by tracking edits\nand translations separately\nThe software tracks edits and translations separately, meaning that it\ndoesn't treat the last paragraph any differently. You can edit in the last\nparagraph and the edit will get applied without your having to use the\n\"Retransmit text\" function.\nThis, combined with apply on pause, essentially makes the\n\"Retransmit text\" function obsolete. You can remove it from your realtime\nmacros, although it doesn't actually do any harm. It's just unnecessary.\n1234 Eclipse Help\n27 AccuCap: Closed Captioning for Eclipse users\nAccuCap: Closed\nCaptioning for Eclipse\nusers\nClosed captioning is the process of adding text (captions) to a live or\nvideotaped broadcast. The captions may be added during live broadcast\n(realtime), or via scripts that have been set up by the captioner in advance.\nRealtime captions are created by a steno writer, translated by Eclipse, sent to\nan encoder, and finally transmitted to a decoder, which places the text on the\nvideo display. Script and realtime text may be combined in the same\nbroadcast. The captioner may be on-site at the television station, off-site at a\ncaptioning center, or at home, sending captions via a modem connection.\nIf you are a court reporter using the Eclipse CAT system, this section of\nthe help/manual will help you become familiar with AccuCap's Closed\nCaptioning functions, which include all of Eclipse's realtime functions with\nadditional features specific to captioning. You can âpracticeâ the process while\nyou are training to be certified as a captioner, and become familiar with all\nthe features which will help you create captions as accurate as your court\ntranscripts.\n27.1 Preconfiguring your system\nPreconfiguring your system\nBefore beginning any closed captioning operations, you can import many\nof the appropriate default document settings, output settings, display\nsettings, keyboard commands and macros to pre-configure your system for\nclosed captioning.\nIf you have previously installed Eclipse and have one or more users\nconfigured already, first make a backup of your user files. In Eclipse choose\nTools/Backup and backup the User Settings and Main Dictionary for your\ncurrent User.\nBefore importing the AccuCap settings, go to User Settings/User, click\non the button Save Settings, and enter a new name. Click on OK, and then\nenter a new user name. Using a name like \"Yourname-CAP\" will help you find\nyour captioning user settings on a network or multi-user system.\nAccuCap: Closed Captioning for Eclipse users 1235\nGo to User settings/User/Import settings, select the âAccuCAP.setâ file,\nwhich is located in the Eclipse folder (the default program folder), and click\nOpen. The User settings transfer dialog box will open. You can see that only\nthe pertinent settings are available for importing. Import All of the selected\ninformation.\nYou should download the latest version of Eclipse from the website, as\nthis will contain the most up-to-date captioning features. It is under\nSupport/Downloads/Eclipse.

If you are a coordinator with an Eclipse\nedit station, you can send scripted captions while also receiving a feed from a\ncaptioner through a serial port and switching back and forth between the\nscript and the feed. The following instructions are for the captioning\ncoordinator.\nFirst, set the User settings/Input/Writer type to ânone.â Select COM\nport and hit the Setup button to configure the input port for the non-writer.\nThis is the port that you will be able to receive data on and pass it through to\nthe outputs.\nTo toggle on the port pass-through, go to Tools/Edit toggles and turn\non the checkbox that reads External COM port input. Then hit OK to close\nout of the dialog. You can write a macro to accomplish that toggling function\nin a single step. If you have the closed captioning preview window open, you\nwill see a (External input enabled) message.\nNow, any data coming in through the input port will be sent to all of the\noutputs directly. If you are hooked to two or more encoders, they will all get\nthe same data sent to them. (When this feature is off, all data coming in\nthrough that port will be ignored.)\nThe data will be interpreted to create a record of what is being written in\nrealtime. The sample in the captioning preview window is not an exact copy of\nwhat appears on the viewer's screens. It only shows text and linefeeds, not\npositioning, indentation, colors, or other decoder-specific formatting.\nIt also takes this data and feeds it into Eclipse document files as\nfollows:\nAfter starting a realtime session, you can optionally create a file named\n\"extpreview.ecl\" (A macro to create and open this file is recommended.)\nIf the translator can see that this file is open, then any data coming in\nfrom the external COM port will be added to this file so that you can see what\nthe captioner is writing.\nAccuCap: Closed Captioning for Eclipse users 1237\nIf the external output is on, the data will ALSO be sent to the output\nAND the realtime file. Script lines will also be sent to the realtime file.\nIn summary, you should have three windows open: The script, the\nextpreview file, and the realtime file.\nThe script will show the material that you can transmit at any time. The\nextpreview file will always show the external input in its entirety. The realtime\nwill show only what has actually been transmitted from either source,\ndepending on whether the user has hit commands to send script lines, or\nwhether the external output was activated.\nWhen switching from scripts to realtime, it's possible that the preview\nwindow could have some text already written that should appear on the air.\nYou can use the âsend script lineâ function to send all of the text in a marked\nblock, so you can switch from script to realtime and simultaneously transmit\nsome of the already-written text.\nThe ideal way to do this would be with a macro. Assume that you have\nleft-clicked or otherwise navigated to the spot in the extpreview file where the\nrealtime should resume. The macro could block mark starting with that\nposition (or perhaps move Home first to the beginning of the line) then hit\nthe \"end of document\" command to block mark from there to the end. Use the\nSend script line to send that text, then the Edit toggles, enable external\noutput, OK, then switch windows back to the script.\nWith that macro, you can click on the screen with the mouse and hit one\nbutton to resume realtime from a point in the text that was written a few\nseconds ago before the switch.\n27.4 Setting up the output\nSetting up the output\nThere are a number of Output Formats that relate to captioning, but we will\nbegin with the most commonly used: Closed Captioning.\n1. Go to User settings and select the Realtime tab.\n2. If there is already a âClosed Captioningâ output selection under the Output\nformats, click on it and hit the Change button. Otherwise, hit the Add button\nand select âClosed captioningâ as the output format. In either case, the\nOutput format dialog box opens.\n1238 Eclipse Help\n3. If you are connecting directly to an Encoder, make sure that Com port is\nselected from the dropdown list. To configure the port, click the Setup>>\nbutton to the right of that.\n4. Select the Port and Baud rate\nappropriate for your captioning device.\nThe default settings are Baud rate of\n1200, Parity none, Data bits 8, and Stop\nbits 1, which will work for most encoders.\n5. If you wish to dial up the closed\ncaptioning device using your modem,\nselect your Modem from the Comm\ndevice: dropdown list, and use the Setup\nbutton to configure the modem settings.\n6. If you want to send the same data to\ntwo modems, you can set up separate\noutputs with identical values, but with\ndifferent modems selected from the\nComm device: dropdown list.\nTo determine which Com port is\nassociated with your modem,\nÂ· Click on the Device manager button.\nÂ· Double-click on Modem or Phone and Modem Options.\nÂ· Double-click on your modem, and select the Modem folder tab. Your modem's\nCom port will be listed.\nAccuCap: Closed Captioning for Eclipse users 1239\nNOTE: You have now completed the minimum setup you need in order to begin\nClosed Captioning. Additional settings, like those to control the way the captions\nappear onscreen, are preferences you can adjust at any time. Before beginning a\nsession, refer to Appendix A, page , for dictionary entries you will need to include in\nyour dictionary before captioning.\n27.5 Additional Output Options\nAdditional Output Options\nIn the Output format dialog box, you can set up the output\ncharacteristics to conform to your preferences. In addition to setting your\npreferences here, many of these features can be adjusted as you write, using\nhot-keys, macros and dictionary entries.\nÂ· All caps: Sets the output to appear entirely in upper-case letters.\nClosed captions are nearly always in all caps. You will be able to set up\ndictionary entries for exceptions, like the lower-case c in names like\n\"McTAVISH.\" The default is on (checked).\nÂ· Auto-dial: When this checkbox is on, the dialing dialog will appear\nautomatically if you have a modem selected as your output device. If\nit is off, the realtime will start without dialing the modem and you will\nbe required to dial manually using the âPhone numbersâ dialog when\nyou are ready to connect.\nÂ· Allow backspaces: Leave this option off if you do NOT wish to allow\nbackspace characters to back up over existing text. Backspacing over\ncharacters in captions is extremely slow and disconcerting to the\nviewer. Note that you can still delete one word in realtime even if this\noption is turned off. If your flush word delay (see below) is set\ncorrectly, the errors you correct will not appear onscreen.\no Note: if you have closed captioning as your primary (first) output\ntype and you have \"Allow backspaces\" turned off, if you hit the\n{DELETE} stroke and it's too late to delete the word written, the\n{DELETE} stroke will do nothing. In other words, you will no longer\nrun into situations where the software deletes the word from the\nediting screen and leaves it on the captioning screenâif it can't be\nremoved from the captioning screen, it won't be removed from the\nediting screen, either.\nÂ· Uniform boxes: Adds black opaque spaces to the end of each closed\ncaption line, making each line of the captioning display the same\nlength. The default is off.\n1240 Eclipse Help\nÂ· Force margins: If you are using multiple, different realtime\ndisplay/output methods, this function can force each separate output\nformat to use a specific set of margins, regardless of the current\nparagraph format. When this option is off (the default setting), the\ntext on the display conforms to the paragraph margins set in User\nSettings/Paragraph. When this option is on, the Eclipse screen will not\nchange, but the output format will change, so that each paragraph will\nfollow the margins specified in the output setup. This allows you to\nwrite a normal 54-column court reporting document, for example,\nwhile still outputting to a 32-column display. For more information on\nparagraph formating and captioning, see the section on Formatting\ntranscripts in the Eclipse Manual.\nÂ· Flush word delay: The amount of time (in millisecondsâfor example,\n2000 milliseconds=2 seconds) the system will wait before transmitting\nthe very last word written to the captioning display. Each word will\nwait until the following space is transmitted before it is displayed.\nSetting this to zero turns the option off, and the system will not wait\nat all. You can set this delay so that you will have the opportunity to\ndelete a word the viewer has not yet seen.\no Note that a space will force out the previous word, so this is only an\nissue for the very last word.\no This option allows you to delete the last word before it displays.\no This feature also allows you to add suffixes to a word before it\ndisplays so that it can word-wrap to the next line if it needs to.\nÂ· Timeout to blank: The amount of time (in milliseconds) the system\nwill wait before blanking the display automatically. Setting this to zero\nturns the option off, and causes the system to wait indefinitely.\nÂ· Wait time to blank: The amount of time (in milliseconds) the system\nwill wait after you send a \"blank\" stroke before the screen blanks. Set\nthis to zero if you want the screen to blank immediately upon receipt\nof the blank command.\nÂ· Starting row: The starting row number (1-15) of the closed captions.\nThere are 15 rows total on a captioning display. The minimum number\nof rows to display is 2. The rows are numbered from the top down, so\na starting row number of 1 positions the captions at the top of the\nscreen, while a starting row number of 12, 13, or 14 places them at\nthe bottom.\nÂ· Total rows: The total number of rows of closed captions. The minimum\nnumber of rows is 2; the maximum is 4.\nAccuCap: Closed Captioning for Eclipse users 1241\nÂ· Maximum rows: Maximum lines in the current output format. This\nsetting determines the number of lines on the current format's\ncaptioning display. For example, Line-21 captioning has a maximum of\n15 lines on the screen. TeleText output has 20. To allow the captioning\npreview window to simulate an LED display, you could set this value to\n3 or 4. If this value is set to a small number, the status display\nshowing the current position, passthrough mode, etc., will be\nomitted.\nÂ· Maximum WPM: This option sets a maximum speed that words are\nallowed to display on the screen. If the written rate goes too high, this\noption will begin intentionally pausing slightly between each word\ndisplayed. When the written rate slows down, the display will continue\nand will catch up with the captioner.\nÂ· Mode: This determines the mode the encoder is placed into prior to\ncaptioning (âpassthroughâ or âblockâ). âBlockâ mode stops incoming or\nexisting captions and allows your captions to be displayed.\nâPassthroughâ mode allow other captions (for example, those for a\nclosed-captioned commercial) to go through. You can leave this set to\n\"Passthrough\" if you turn on the \"Auto-Block\" mode (see below).\nÂ· Hangup mode: This determines the mode the encoder will be placed\ninto when the captioning session is completed (âpassthroughâ or\nâblockâ). Setting the Hangup mode to âPassthroughâ avoids the\nproblem of hanging up but continuing to block encoder output.\nÂ· Attribute: Sets the text to default to Normal, Underlined, Italics or\nBold (flashing). Italics are generally used to indicate a narrator is\nspeaking. If captioning a narrated program, rather than using this\noption, you may want to set up a separate paragraph type for a\nnarrator with the default font set to italics.\nÂ· Semi-transparent background: Some decoders support a background\nthat is semi-transparent, allowing the viewer to see partially through\nthe captions. The default is off.\nÂ· Foreground: Some decoders support a range of colors for the captions.\nThe default is white, as captions are usually sent as white letters on a\nblack background.\nÂ· Background: Some decoders support a range of colors for the\nbackground of the captions. The default is black.\nÂ· Caption Channel: Allows closed captioning output for foreign-language\ncaptions. The choices are CC1 through CC4 and Text1 through Text4.\nNote that alternate language captions are done on CC3 (not CC2).\nÂ· Encoder: The default setting is \"Smart Encoder\" which will work for\nmost encoders. If your encoder does not work with the standard\n(\"Smart encoder\") setting, there are additional options including the\nUltech encoder and Link encoder.\n1242 Eclipse Help\nÂ· Auto-block: This option automatically puts the encoder in âblockâ\nmode (blocking any pre-existing captions) when any realtime text is\ntransmitted. As soon as you begin sending captions, the system will\noverride the Passthrough mode, if it is active, and send your captions\nto the display. You can check this box and leave it checked to be sure\nyour captions will go through when you send them. Note that if you\nrun the macro to suspend output (for example, if you want to work on\nyour dictionary during a break), it will override the Auto-block feature.\nÂ· Mode reiteration: Turning this feature on will send the \"Block mode\"\ncommand at the beginning of every line so that the program will\ncontinuously make sure that it's in the correct mode to send captions,\nin case the encoder gets tweaked. Some encoders don't like this, so if\nyou are getting garbage characters at the beginnings or ends of lines,\ntry turning this feature off.\nÂ· Caption style: Pop-on or Roll-up: Normally, realtime captions would be\nroll-up. Roll-up captions appear on the screen a word at a time (in\nrealtime), or a line at a time (when sending scripts). With Pop-on\ncaptions an entire paragraph appears at once (up to four lines). The\npop-on caption style is typically used for opening or closing credits in\nrealtime.\no Pop-on captions support colors, and can fomat accoding to alignment\nsettings (left-flush, centered, right-flush).\no If you display a pop-up caption or credit, once you begin writing on\nthe writer, the scripts will return to roll-up mode in their original\nposition, even in scripts, so further scripted captions will roll-up\ninstead of popping on.\no After sending a pop-up credit, the cursor will move to the beginning\nof the next paragraph, skipping any script commands, if applicable.\no Pre-send: Used with pop-on captions, this option allows you to presend\na caption before sending the command to display it. The\nencoding/decoding process is very slow, and pre-sending a caption\nallows it to go through in the background, and appear all at once\nwhen you press the \"send\" command for the next caption.\n27.5.1 Teletext output format\nTeletext output format\nAnother option for closed captioning is Teletext, used primarily in the\nUnited Kingdom. Teletext has many of the same features as closed\ncaptioning. Eclipse will display as many rows as will fit on the Teletext\nscreen.\nAccuCap: Closed Captioning for Eclipse users 1243\nFor Teletext users, the Caption channel is an editable combo box in\nwhich you can type the desired page, such as 800, 801, 888, etc. Setting the\npage number to 999 turns the encoder off, which is equivalent to going into\npassthrough mode on a U.S. encoder. The passthrough and block commands\nin the software set the page number to 999 or to the desired transmission\npage number as appropriate.\nIf you set the Teletext output to \"pop-on\" mode, it will pop text when\nstarting a new paragraph, creating offline pop-on captions like those used in\nTeletext systems in the UK. In order to activate this mode, set the User\nsettings/Realtime/Output/Mode to 2 Pop-on captions instead of roll-up.\nWhen you write a new paragraph stroke, the previous paragraph will be sent\nto the captioning display immediately. The position will be determined, and\nlimited, by the starting row and total row settings. It will always display at\nthe bottom of the range, and will never display more rows than specified, so if\nyou write too large of a paragraph, part of it will be omitted.\nFor example, if you have your settings to start at row 14 and have 2\nlines of captions, a one-line caption will appear on line 15. A two-line caption\nwill appear on lines 14 and 15.\nYou can break your lines manually, but if you don't break the line\nmanually, the software will automatically break it as soon as the line reaches\nthe maximum number indicated by the User\nsettings/Realtime/Output/Lines of captioning. The break will attempt to\nfind a logical place to break the line, preferring to break just after a comma or\nsemicolon or just before a conjunction. If it is unable to find any of those\nindicators, it will simply break at the end of the line.\n27.6 Setting up phone books\nSetting up phone books\nYou can set up one or more phone books which will contain the phone\nnumbers your modem will dial in to for you to transmit captions to the\nstation. Correct configuration and reliable connections are critical to the\nprocess of sending captions, so plan to allow sufficient time in advance to\nestablish your connection and do a \"dry run.\" If this is a new connection, or\nyou have installed a new modem, make an appointment with the TV station\ntechnical personnel, and with ASI support, to do a dry run and be sure your\ncaptions are getting through.\nTo Manage your phone books:\nÂ· Select the Tools menu/Phone numbers (Ctrl+F12). The Access\nnumbers dialog box will open.\n1244 Eclipse Help\nÂ· Use the Add button to add as many phone numbers as you like to one\nphone book. Use the format âDescription:numberâ to type in the item.\nEverything after the colon will be sent directly to the modem during\ndialing, so you can use constructions like Channel 12, WCAP: 9,555-\n1234.\nÂ· Use the Delete button to remove phone numbers and the Change\nbutton to edit them.\nÂ· Use the Clear button on the phone book to clear it out if you wish to\nstart a whole new phone book from scratch. Note that this does NOT\nerase the file unless you then hit the Save button.\nÂ· Once you have set up a phone book, use the Save button to save it. If\nyou make changes to the phone book, you will be reminded to save it\nwhen you close it.\nÂ· You can have as many different phone books as you like and use the\nLoad button to retrieve them. The system remembers the last phone\nbook you had open and will automatically retrieve it the next time you\nrun the program.\nÂ· You can use the Modem box at the top of the page to select the\nmodem you are dialing if you have set up more than one modem in\nyour User settings/Realtime tab/Output format.\nÂ· You can re-order phone numbers in the list using the and Ctrl+\nkeys.\nAccuCap: Closed Captioning for Eclipse users 1245\n27.7 Starting a captioning session\nStarting a captioning session\n1. Follow the instructions for setting up input options and starting a\nrealtime job in the Realtime Section of the Eclipse manual.\n2. If you have selected the modem as the output port, the Phone list\ndialog box will open.\n3. If you have more than one modem setup, there is a Modem dropdown\nlist at the top of the dialog box so that you can select which\nmodem you will be dialing or hanging up. If you have auto-dial\nturned on for each of your outputs, then the phone number dialog will\nappear once for each output that should be auto-dialed when you first\nstart realtime.\n4. Select the phone number you wish to dial and press the Dial button\nor double-click the phone number to dial it. Once connected, it will\noperate exactly as if you were connected directly to the closed\ncaptioning device.\n5. If the modem connection drops during a session, the dialing dialog\nwill appear automatically and will begin dialing to attempt to\nreconnect. This requires no intervention by the user unless a problem\noccurs during redialing. It is not necessary to constantly monitor your\nmodem connection; AccuCap is monitoring the modem connection for\nyou. An M will appear on the status bar to indicate you are connected.\n6. Note that the auto-redial function in Eclipse will not auto-redial until\nall of the modems have failed. If both modems fail, it will attempt to\nredial the first one.\n7. If you do not wish to dial the encoder when you first start up a\nrealtime session, you do not need to do so. You can escape from the\ndialing dialog when starting translation, and at any point in the\nfuture, you may bring up the phone dialog and issue the dialing\ncommand by pressing the dial button.\n8. In addition, it is also possible to bring up the phone dialog and use\nthe Hang up button to hang up the connection. You can hang up and\nredial as often as desired without having to stop and restart\ntranslation.\na. NOTE: If you have trouble getting the modem to connect, try a\ndifferent baud rate and/or try setting a maximum baud rate for the\nmodem in the device driver. In testing, for example, an old 2400\nbaud modem simply wouldn't communicate at 1200 baud unless\nthe device driver was set to a maximum of 1200. To set the baud\nrate for your device driver, go to Windows Start/Settings/Control\nPanel and double click the modem icon. In the Properties tab,\nselect the drop-down list under Maximum Speed, and select the\nbaud rate of 1200.\n1246 Eclipse Help\n9.

This is sometimes necessary if an\nencoder is behaving erratically, which can sometimes happen as a\nresult of an unreliable modem connection or because of commands\nthat were issued to the encoder from another source.\nAccuCap: Closed Captioning for Eclipse users 1251\nÂ· Checking the Transmit test checkbox will continuously transmit data to\nthe captioning output using the current WPM rate as a guide. If you\nhave the WPM rate set to zero (disabling the WPM limiter), it will\ndefault to 160 WPM. If you are using a script file, the script will jump\nto the top when complete, transmitting repeatedly until the test it\nstopped.\nÂ· Other selections on this dialog allow you to select Caption style,\nchoosing between Pop-on captions and Roll-up captions, and to enable\nthe Pre-send function for the pop-on captions.\nSuspending the Output\nYou may want to suspend output to the encoder temporarily, during a\ncommercial break, for example, in order to practice some words or enter some\nnew words and global them.\nTo do so, use the Tools menu/Edit toggles (or Shift+Alt+E) and turn\nthe RT output setting to Off (Alt+8). In order to remind you to turn the\noutput back on before resuming captioning, a large âXâ in the Foreground\ncolor will appear on the preview screen.\nYou can use F4 to toggle the suspend on and off.\n1252 Eclipse Help\n27.9 Macros to position captions on the fly:\nMacros to position captions on the fly:\nA series of macros has been created which will make the process of\npositioning captions on the fly much faster. To create your macros, see the\nsection on Hyperkeys, Macros, and Keyboard Shortcuts in the Eclipse Manual.\nNote that to simplify writing macros that use the positioning dialog (the\nCaption Control Panel, (Shift+Alt+P)), the OK button has a speed key\n(Alt+O).\nThe following are the Realtime macros that control caption position and\ndisplay modes.\nAlt+F Change Paragraph (Hyperkey F)\nThis macro opens a dialog box with a list of paragraph types which apply\nto captions. You can highlight the type you want to apply to the current\nparagraph and press Enter to select it, or simply type the number to the left\nof each choice (eg., typing 4 selects the \"Right 1\" type) or type the initial\nletter (C or N).\nÂ· The \"Left 1\" Paragraph type has a left margin of 0, and a right margin\nof 28; there are 28 characters of captioning text. This option can also\nbe set using the dictionary entry {L1}.\nLeft 1 paragraph type:\nÂ· The \"Left 2\" paragraph type has a left margin of 0, and a right margin\nof 24; there are 24 characters of captioning text. This option can also\nbe set using the dictionary entry {L2}.\nLeft 2 paragraph type:\nAccuCap: Closed Captioning for Eclipse users 1253\nÂ· The \"Left 3\" paragraph type has a left margin of 0, and a right margin\nof 20; there are 20 characters of captioning text. This option can also\nbe set using the dictionary entry {L3}.\nLeft 3 paragraph type:\nÂ· The \"Right 1\" paragraph type has a left margin of 4, and a right\nmargin of 32; there are 28 characters of captioning text. This option\ncan also be set using the dictionary entry {R1}.\nRight 1 paragraph type:\nÂ· The \"Right 2\" paragraph type has a left margin of 8, and a right\nmargin of 32; there are 24 characters of captioning text. This option\ncan also be set using the dictionary entry {R2}.\nRight 2 paragraph type:\nÂ· The \"Right 3\" paragraph type has a left margin of 12, and a right\nmargin of 32; there are 20 characters of captioning text. This option\ncan also be set using the dictionary entry {R3}.\nRight 3 paragraph type:\n1254 Eclipse Help\nÂ· The \"Normal\" paragraph type has a left margin of 0, and a right\nmargin of 32; there are 32 characters of captioning text. This option\ncan also be set using the dictionary entry {P}.\nNormal paragraph type:\nAlt+L Change Position Hyperkey O\nThis macro opens a dialog box with a list of vertical position options. You\ncan highlight the type you want to apply to the current paragraph and press\nEnter to select it, or type the initial letter of each choice (A, B, E, or T).\nThe \"Alternate\" position choice toggles between captions at the top of\nthe screen and at the bottom (equivalent to Toggle top/bottom on the Caption\nControl Panel (Shift+Alt+P). \"Bottom\" places the captions at the bottom of\nthe screen; \"Top\" places them at the top. \"Elevated\" places the captions one\nor two rows up from the bottom of the screen (equivalent to Up from the\nbottom on the Caption Control Panel (Shift+Alt+P).\nAlt+B Blank Display Hyperkey B\nAccuCap: Closed Captioning for Eclipse users 1255\nThis macro blanks the display, removing the captions. It will wait the\namount of time specified in the Wait Time to Blank option of the User\nSettings/Realtime/Closed Captioning/Change . . . Output format options. If\nthe Wait Time to Blank option is set to zero, the screen will blank\nimmediately.\nCtrl+1 or Keypad 2 Bottom, full width\nThis macro sends the captions to the bottom of the screen, with 32\ncharacters per line (the \"Normal\" paragraph format).\nCtrl+2 or Keypad 1 Bottom, left\nThis macro send the captions to the bottom of the screen, with a right\nmargin of 24 (specifies the \"Left 2\" paragraph format).\nCtrl+3 or Keypad 3 Bottom, right\nThis macro sends the captions to the bottom of the screen, with a left\nmargin of 8 (specifies the \"Right 2\" paragraph format).\nCtrl+4 or Keypad 8 Top, full width\nThis macro sends the captions to the top of the screen, with 32\ncharacters per line (the \"Normal\" paragraph format).\nCtrl+5 or Keypad 7 Top, left\nThis macro send the captions to the top of the screen, with a right\nmargin of 24 (specifies the \"Left 2\" paragraph format).\nCtrl+6 or Keypad 9 Top, right\nThis macro sends the captions to the top of the screen, with a left\nmargin of 8 (specifies the \"Right 2\" paragraph format).\nF2 Passthrough Mode\nThis macro puts the output into \"Passthrough Mode,\" allowing other\ncaptions to be displayed, and stopping the captions you are sending.\nF6 Block mode\nThis macro puts the output into \"Block mode,\" blocking incoming or\nexisting captions and allowing yours to be displayed.\n1256 Eclipse Help\nF3 Blank and Passthrough\nThis macro sends the \"Blank display\" command, and puts the display\ninto Passthrough mode. This will blank any of your captions still on the\ndisplay, before allowing other captions through.\nShift+F3 Blank and Pass and Suspend\nThis macro sends the \"Blank Display\" command, sets the mode to\nPassthrough and suspends your output, until you turn it back on.\nShift+F4 Suspend on\nThis macro suspends output to the encoder, and places a red \"X\" on\nyour Closed Caption Preview window reminding you that your captions are not\ngoing through.\nCtrl+F4 Suspend off\nThis macro turns off the \"suspend output\" feature, and enables your\ncaptions to go through to the encoder.\nF4 Suspend toggle\nThis macro toggles between suspending your output, and allowing your\ncaptions to go through.\nThese macros and the keystrokes and Hyperkeys used to execute them\nare listed in the Appendix. They are contained in the AccuCap.set file, which\nyou imported into your User Settings.\n27.10 Setting up scripts\nSetting up scripts\nScript files are regular text files that contain pre-scripted material for\nclosed captioning. In the simplest case, you will receive a text file, which you\nwill open, and send line-by-line during the broadcast.\nThe basic steps for using script files are:\n1. Have a script file prepared.\n2. Start a Realtime session.\nAccuCap: Closed Captioning for Eclipse users 1257\n3. Go to your script file. Go to the top of the file.\n4. Transmit the data one line at a time using the\nTools/Realtime/Send script line function (F12). You can also send\nrealtime captions between lines of script without having to toggle\nback to your realtime document to write.\nNOTE: Scripts are sent in their original case regardless of the âall capsâ\nsetting in the output setup. This allows you to edit the scripts and specify\nwhich parts of the script should be upper case and which parts should be\nlower case. You can block mark the entire file and use Shift F6 to upper case\nthe entire file.\n27.10.1 Formatting a file as a script\nFormatting a file as a script\nOn the Tool menu/Realtime is an option to Format script (Alt+F12). This\nprepares text for prescripted captioning by breaking up all of the text into\nnew paragraphs at every terminal punctuation mark, i.e. where any of the\nfollowing symbols [.?!:] is followed by two spaces.\nNormally, it will format the entire document. If you mark a block before\nexecuting this function, it will only format the text in the block.\n27.10.2 Script Commands\nScript Commands\nScript files can also contain special commands for controlling the output\nof the scripted material. You can insert a Script command by using the\nEdit/Insert/New Print command function (Alt+N) and selecting âScript\ncommandâ from the list. This will insert a Print command in the form of\nSc:command. Note that the script transmission function will skip over print\ncommands and not transmit them, even if the cursor is moved there\nmanually.\n1258 Eclipse Help\nScript commands are used to define segments of the script, setting the\nbeginning and ending points for each segment, controlling the position and\nmode of the captions, and where the segments can be found. (A script's\nsegments can be in more than one text file.)\nHere is a list of the script commands:\nÂ· S|segment name -- This allows you to define the start of a particular\nscript segment or news story, such as âS|Bank robberyâ\nÂ· E -- End of segment. This script command marks the end of the\ncurrent segment. (Note that is it not necessary to put in an âendâ\ncommand if the very next command is another âstartâ command (S|\ntitle.) The start of a new segment implies the end of the current one,\nso no end command is needed.)\nÂ· B -- Blank. This script command will blank the screen. Script\ncommands are executed when the lines below them are transmitted,\nso if you wish for the screen to be COMPLETELY blank, a blank line\nshould follow this command.\nÂ· P|r,l -- Position at row r, l lines of captioning.\no For example, P|12,2 would position the captioning display at row 12\nand set it for 2 roll-up lines of captioning.\no Either value can be set to zero if you wish to leave the existing value\nalone. For example, P|1,0 would move the captions to the top (row\n1) without affecting the number of lines of captioning.\nAccuCap: Closed Captioning for Eclipse users 1259\nÂ· W|filename -- Play a wave file during transmitting a script. Make sure\nthe wave file is stored in the program folder (Usually C:\\Program\nfiles\\Advantage Software\\Eclipse.) For example, if you had a wave file\ncalled âding.wavâ you would put W|ding on the script line. You can use\nthis feature as a warning signal or reminder of something coming up\nin the file that needs special attention.\nÂ· M|mode switch â Change between pop-on and roll-up captions. In\norder to create a script that uses pop-on captions, you must put in a\nâmodeâ script command.\no The two modes are âpâop-on and ârâoll-up. The syntax is M|P for\npop-on and M|R for roll-up. If you use the âsend script lineâ function\non a script paragraph that appears directly below the M|P script\ncommand line, that caption and all of the ones below it will pop on\ninstead of rolling on.\no Keep in mind that when you are popping on captions, it will send an\nentire paragraph at one time, so keep your paragraphs small.\no The \"pre-send\" function works with pop-on captions. When you hit\nthe \"transmit\" function it will pop up the previous caption and will\n\"pre-send\" the current caption to the decoder's memory so that it\nwill appear immediately when you hit the send command for the\nnext caption. Without pre-send, the caption will be transmitted in its\nentirety when you press the send command, which may take a\nsecond or two before it is displayed.\no Also note that if you display a pop-up caption, once you begin\nwriting on the writer, the scripts will return to roll-up mode so that\nfurther scripted captions will roll up instead of popping on.\n27.10.3 Setting up script lists\nSetting up script lists\nUnder the Window menu/View is a function called view Script list\n(Shift+F12).\nThe Script list manager opens, which allows you to manage pre-scripted\ninformation for closed captioning.\n1260 Eclipse Help\nIt can be used by any output format and could be useful for any realtime event.\nÂ· To add segments to the script manager, place the cursor on a segment script\ncommand (as listed above, S|Weather or S|Sports) and go into the Script list\nwindow. Then use the Add function to add that segment to the script list.\nÂ· If you wish to go automatically through the current file and collect all of the\nsegment commands at once, use the Import button instead of the Add button.\nThat will import all of the segment commands from the current file and place\nthem in the script list.\nÂ· You can add as many segments as you wish. You can reorder the segments by\nholding down the Ctrl key while pressing the cursor keys. Normally, the cursor\nkeys will move the highlight bar. With Ctrl held down, it moves the current\n(highlighted) segment up or down in the order.\nÂ· You can use the Delete button to remove a segment. Highlight a segment\nname and click Delete.\nÂ· You can use the Clear all button to clear all of the script segments off the\nscript in preparation for working with a new list.\nÂ· You can use the Save button to save an entire script list. When you click on the\nSave button, the Save as dialog box opens, prompting you to enter a filename\n(with the extension .scl, indicating it is a script list file). Type in a name (or use\nthe defaultâthe current file name) and press enter or click Save.\nÂ· You can use the Load button to load a previously saved script list file. Click\nLoad and choose the file from the list of .scl files that appears in the Open\ndialog box. Press Enter or click Open.\nÂ· If you select a segment on the list and hit the OK button, the cursor will jump\nto the beginning of the highlighted segment.\nAccuCap: Closed Captioning for Eclipse users 1261\nÂ· If you hit Cancel, it will jump out of the script manager without moving the\ncursor.\nÂ· If you check the Leave script list dialog box open checkbox, the script\nwindow will remain open even when it's not active, so that you can see what\nthe next story will be. If you check this, it will stay on until you uncheck it.\nÂ· You can still use Shift+F12 to jump into the script window to perform\noperations in it.\nÂ· You can place the cursor in the script list and hit Ctrl+C to copy the list, and\npaste it into any Windows program.\nÂ· The script list manager will always be scrolled down as far as it can go without\nmaking the highlight bar disappear, so that it will show as many upcoming\nstories as possible.\nÂ· Note that you can have multiple segments in one file, and/or you can have\nthem spread around in multiple files. Segments must have different names; if\nthe script list manager finds an exact match, it will force the names to be\ndifferent, by adding an extra â.â character to the end of both the entry in the\nscript line and the script line in the document.\nAs you are outputting script lines with the Tools/Realtime/Send script line\ncommand, when you reach the end of a segment, this function automatically goes into\nthe script list manager, moves the highlight bar down to the next story and jumps into\nit. That makes it possible to simply use the F12 key to transmit all of the scripts one\nafter the other without having to execute any other commands.\nWith AccuCap, you can send a combination of pre-scripted text and Realtime\ntext, as in a news broadcast where the segments are sent to you in a text file, but you\nneed to add the newspersons' commentary between news segments. You can open\nmultiple windows for the realtime and non-realtime documents. A convenient feature\nof the system is that it will remember the window positions for the realtime documents\nand the non-realtime documents separately (as long as neither is maximized.) That\nway, it is possible to tile the windows so that you can see both the realtime text and\nthe upcoming script text on the screen at the same time.\nWhen you transmit a script line to the captioning output, the line will also get\ncopied to the realtime document so that the realtime document will contain, in order,\nall of the text that went out on the air no matter what the source. The copied script\nlines will have the current timecodes, so that the final file will have correct and\nconsecutive timecodes throughout.\n27.10.4 Script transmission in all caps or mixed case\nScript transmission in all caps or mixed case\nScripts will default to being transmitted in their original case, regardless\nof the state of the \"All caps\" flag in the output settings, so even if you are\noutputting in all caps in realtime, the scripts will appear in mixed case.\n1262 Eclipse Help\nHowever, if you turn on the User Settings/Document/Advanced/All\ncaps print checkbox for the current document, then that document will be\ntransmitted according to the \"All caps\" flag settings in the output setup.\nIn the case of the output being set to all caps and the document being\nset to all caps, that script will be transmitted in all caps except for those\nportions bounded by literal case on/off commands. So when\ndesigning/transmitting a script that is going to have some material in mixed\ncase and some in upper case, you have two options:\n1. Set the document to print in all caps and surround any mixed case\nportions with literal case on/off characters (this method would work\nbest for re-transmitting a realtime file since the literal on/off\ncharacters will already be around speakers, etc., due to the dictionary\nentries containing {S:Name} or {l1} and {l0} commands). Note that\neven without the literal case off command, the software will\nautomatically revert to the default capitalization mode (usually all\ncaps) at the beginning of a new paragraph.\n2. Leave the All caps print function off and manually capitalize or lowercase\nthe text so that it looks exactly as you want it to transmit (for\nexample, for pop-up credits).\n27.10.5 Importing a script in an ASCII file\nImporting a script in an ASCII file\nIf you or your employer or organization has a script prepared for your use, you\ncan import it using File/Import.\nWhen importing an ASCII file, CAPtivator encoder commands (like \\S for a âslug\nlineâ which describes a story, and \\B for blank) will convert into the analogous script\ncommands. If CAPtivator scripts contain color, italics, underscore, etc., commands\n(such as the \\A attribute command) or special symbols for extended characters (such\nas letters with accent marks, and musical notes), they will be converted into Eclipse\nscripts. The \\P (âblank-and-passâ) is converted into a blank command.\nAlso, the system will automatically start a new paragraph after any line that ends\nwith a period, and will avoid inserting blank paragraphs. All script commands will force\na new line even if the \\E is not present, to ensure that the body of the text is not\nmistaken for part of a command. The resulting imported ASCII will be able to be used\nfor a captioning script with little or no editing.\n27.10.6 ANSI file output\nANSI file output\nAccuCap: Closed Captioning for Eclipse users 1263\nYou can create an ANSI file when you need a record of exactly what has\ngone to the encoder. The ANSI file can be sent to your captioning company,\nor as a record of a captioning session which goes back and forth between a\nscript file and realtime. To create an ANSI file, go to User\nsettings/Realtime/Output formats and Add ANSI.\nCreating an ANSI file with a new name\nIf you are captioning a session with several programs in a row, you can\nbreak off the ANSI file being created, and begin a new ANSI file with a\ndifferent name, without having to stop and restart the translation.\nTo do this, go to User settings/Realtime/Output formats and select\nChange the ANSI output. Select the Setup button next to the Comm device:\nâfile sharing.â The system will detect that your output is open and active, and\nit will allow you to specify a new path and/or name for a copy of the output\nfile that is already open. Type in the new name (or path and name) and hit\nEnter. It will break off the data written so far and create a file (in the same\nlocation as the original file, unless you specified a different folder) with the\nname you specify, and clear the ANSI output file so it is empty and ready to\nreceive new data from the realtime session already in progress. If you select a\nfilename that already exists, the software will warn you.\n27.11 Macros for Closed Captioning Scripts\nMacros for Closed Captioning Scripts\nThe macros you imported with AccuCap.set include several for use with\nscripts:\nShift+Alt+F Change paragraph type Hyperkey Shift+F\nThis macro opens a dialog box with a list of paragraph types that apply\nto captions. You can highlight the type you want to apply to the current\nparagraph and press Enter to select it, or simply type the number to the left\nof each choice (or the initial letter, C or N for \"Center\" or \"Normal\").\nShift+Alt+L Change position/mode Hyperkey Shift+O\nThis macro opens a dialog box with a list of vertical position options:\nBottom, Top or Elevated. You can highlight the type you want to apply to the\ncurrent paragraph and press Enter to select it, or simply type the initial letter\nof each choice (B, T, or E). A Script command is inserted which will change\nthe position of the captions when they are sent to the encoder.\nAlt+B Blank Display Hyperkey B\nThis macro inserts the Script command \"Sc:B\" which blanks the\nscreen.\nShift+Alt+X Excise Hyperkey X\n1264 Eclipse Help\nThis macro allows you to delete a word from the current paragraph\nbefore sending it to the encoder. You can delete the first, second, third,\nfourth, fifth or sixth word by highlighting (cursor to) your choice and pressing\nEnter, or by selecting it with the mouse, or by typing the number to the left of\nthe choice.\nShift+Alt+I Jump to previous segment Hyperkey\nShift+I\nThis macro moves the cursor to the first word of the previous segment in\nthe script.\nShift+Alt+K Jump to next segment Hyperkey Shift+K\nThis macro moves the cursor to the first word of the next segment in the\nscript.\nThe \"Jump to previous segment\" and \"Jump to next segment\" macros\nalso move the highlight bar on the script list, so that you can always see\nwhere you are on the list.\n27.12 Exporting a Text File\nExporting a Text File\nAt times, you will need to export the text of a completed captioning\nsession. For example, there is a legal requirement to provide captions on any\nInternet-distributed video if the original broadcast version of the video had\ncaptions on it.\nThe File/Export menu item includes these formats for Captioners:\nSCC captioning - Files in this format can be imported by a number of\noff-line captioning software products such as the CPC software. Some\nencoding hardware can directly import .scc files and encode the captions\nstored in them directly to video without using any additional software.\n.scc files contain timecodes (including the document's timecodes offset)\nand captions, so you can do a live captioning job, go back and clean up the\ntext, and then provide a .scc file to the station so that they can burn the\nedited captions on the stored copy of the program for later distribution.\nAccuCap: Closed Captioning for Eclipse users 1265\nSMPTE-TT is a specialized type of XML output that is used for webbased\noff-line captioning. Like the .scc output, this is being used by many\ncompanies in order to comply with the regulations for providing off-line\nversions of on-line captions when videos are published on the web.\nSAMI files are used for post-production captioning on Windows Media\nplayer files.\n27.13 Frequently Asked Questions about Captioning\n27.13.1 How do I make a new line?\n{N}\nTo make a new paragraph (\"new line\"), use the dictionary entry {N}, which will\ncreate a copy of the current paragraph format, equal to a continuation paragraph.\nNote that this dictionary entry can be used in conjunction with other commands:\n{N}>> Begins a new line and introduces a new story\n{?}{N} Begins a new line after terminal punctuation.\n{!}{N} Begins a new line after terminal punctuation.\n{N} Used alone, it will insert a period and start a new line.\n27.13.2 How do I indicate a new speaker is speaking?\n{S:Speaker name}\nThis dictionary entry makes a new line, and adds\n>> Speakername: (SPOKEN TEXT BEGINS . . .)\nThe speaker's name appears in mixed case; the text will be in all caps.\n27.13.3 How do I make a musical note?\nÂ¶\nTo insert a musical note symbol in scripts and dictionary entries, substitute the\nparagraph symbol (Â¶) that will be converted to a musical note on the closed captioning\ndisplay (which does not support the paragraph symbol.) Note that the Closed Caption\nPreview screen will show the musical note as it appears on the decoded display.\nTo insert the paragraph symbol (Â¶) in a script, go to Edit/Insert/Special\nCharacter (hotkey Ctrl+W) and select the paragraph symbol, and click OK. You can\nalso use Ctrl+W to global in the paragraph symbol, or when adding dictionary entries.\n27.13.4 How do I change positions?\nUse the special dictionary entries listed in the Appendix A: Dictionary Entries of\nthis manual. Entries can be combined, for example:\n1266 Eclipse Help\n{POS:1,3}{R2}\nwould position three rows of captions at the top of the page, with the left side\nindented 8 characters.\nYou can also use Keystrokes, which are listed in Appendix C: Keystrokes and\nMacros.\n27.13.5 How do I blank the screen?\n{BLANK}\nThis dictionary entry will blank the screen, subject to the time delay set in \"Wait\ntime to blank.\"\nThe Keystroke Alt+B or Hyperkey B will do the same thing.\n27.13.6 How do I force the last stroke to go to the display?\n{FLUSH}\nThis dictionary entry will send the last stroke to the display, regardless of any of\nthe delay settings.\n27.13.7 How do I stop outputting captions so I can work on my dictionary entries\nwithout sending captions to the display?\nShift+F4 Suspend on\nCtrl+F4 Suspend off\nF4 Toggle Suspend on/off\nThe macro Shift+F4 will suspend the output so you can work on dictionary\nentries during a break. This will override the Autoblock mode, which normally sends\nyour output to the decoder as soon as you begin writing text. When your output is\nsuspended, a red X appears on the preview window, reminding you that your captions\nare not going through.\nTo stop suspending the output, and begin sending your captions to the display,\nuse the macro Ctrl+F4.\nTo toggle between suspend on and suspend off, use F4.\n27.13.8 How do I let other captions go through during a commercial break?\nF2 Passthrough mode\nF6 Block mode\nTo stop your captions from going through, and allow other captions to go to the\ndisplay (as in during a captioned commercial), use F2 to place the display in\nPassthrough mode.\nAccuCap: Closed Captioning for Eclipse users 1267\nTo override any existing captions, and send your captions to the display, use F6,\nwhich places the display in Block mode.\n27.13.9 How do I send credits?\nYou can set up a dictionary entry, {CR:FileName}, that uses the metadictionary\nentry {CR:*}={/\"%/?CCC} to send a credit file.\nFor example, the dictionary entry{CR:CreditABC} would pop on a credit file\nnamed âCreditABC.ecl.â When you use {CR:FileName} to pop on a credit, the system\nwill remember the previous position of the realtime captions and will return there as\nsoon as you begin writing again, and it will return to roll-up mode.\nYou can use this feature in a macro; for example a macro to execute Force\ntranslation, {CR:Name}, Enter in place of Alt+E, Jobname, Ctrl+PgUp, down arrow,\nF12, Ctrl+Q.\n27.13.10How do I change the colors of caption text?\nYou can use a dictionary entry, for example:\n{WHITE}={F:Courier New,13,400,0,CFFFFFF}\n{BLACK}={F:Courier New,13,400,0,C000000}\n{RED}={F:Courier New,13,400,0,C0000FF}\n{GREEN}={F:Courier New,13,400,0,C00FF00}\n{YELLOW}={F:Courier New,13,400,0,C00FFFF}\n{BLUE}={F:Courier New,13,400,0,CFF0000}\n{MAGENTA}={F:Courier New,13,400,0,CFF00FF}\n{CYAN}={F:Courier New,13,400,0,CFFFF00}\nYou can change a paragraph label's font color, which will cause the captioning\noutput to have that label color. This is a simple way to have speaker names appear in\na different color, for example.\n1268 Eclipse Help\n28 AccuCap: Dictionary Entries - Position and Appearance\nof Captions\nDictionary Entries that control the position and\nappearance of captions\nCaption position\nThe horizontal position of the captions is determined by the current\nparagraph format. You can create an unlimited number of paragraphs formats,\nbut to save time, several default formats have been created in the\nAccuCAP.set file:\n{P} Normal: Puts captions border-to-border, from column 1 to 32\n{C} Centered: Indents on both sides 8 characters, leaving 16\ncharacters of captioning in the middle of the screen\n{L1} Left 1: Indents the right side 4 characters\n{L2} Left 2: Indents the right side 8 characters\n{L3} Left 3: Indents the right side 12 characters\n{R1} Right 1: Indents the left side 4 characters\n{R2} Right 2: Indents the left side 8 characters\n{R3} Right 3: Indents the left side 12 characters\n{H:left,right} Start a new paragraph with a particular horizontal\nalignment\n{CR:Creditfilename} Sends a credit file\n{BLANK} â this dictionary entry blanks the display, just as the blank\nbutton on the Change position dialog. If there is a time designated in the\n\"Wait time to Blank\" option in User Settings/Realtime/Output format dialog,\nthe system will wait the specified time before blanking the display.\n{FLUSH} â this dictionary entry forces the very last piece of text you\nwrote to appear on the captioning screen immediately regardless of any of the\ndelay settings.\n{POS:line,rows} â this entry positions the caption lines starting at âlineâ\nand scrolling a total of ârows.â For example, {POS:13,3} would position the\ncaptions at row 13 and would use three lines of captioning. This entry is very\nsimilar to the positioning command used in the scripts, and as with that\ncommand, a value of zero indicates that the current value should not be\nchanged.\nAccuCap: Dictionary Entries - Position and Appearance of Captions 1269\nNote that the characters in brackets, such as {P} for a Normal\nparagraph, represent the syntax for creating dictionary entries that create\nthose paragraphs.\nAuto-detect and/or create a paragraph with\nparticular margins\nYou can use dictionary entries to set up a series of paragraph formats\nbefore a captioning job. The metadictionary syntax is {H:*}={/\"%/?PGA}. To\nuse this feature, if you want to start a new paragraph with a particular\nhorizontal alignment (hence the \"H\") enter it as follows:\n{H:Left column,Right column}\nFor example, {H:0,32} would be a border-to-border caption. (H:4,32}\nwould be indented 4 spaces from the left. Note that when you indent, you do\nnot subtract from the right column. In the example, 4 is not the number of\ncharacters on the line; it is the rightmost column to which text can extend.\nThis function looks for a paragraph type in the current document that\nmatches those margins. If it cannot find one, it makes a copy of the default\nparagraph (usually the \"Normal\" paragraph) and creates a new paragraph\ntype for the new alignment.\nFor example, if you enter {H:5,27} you would probably see a brand new\nparagraph in the User settings/Paragraph/Paragraphs list that reads \"Normal-\n5.27\" Note that these automatically created paragraphs only exist in the\ncurrent document, not in your master settings.\nYou can combine this with other commands. For example, you could\nhave a dictionary entryâ{BLANK}{POS:1,2}{H:6,28}â which would blank\nthe captioning display and place the captions at a specific vertical and\nhorizontal position.\nIn combination with the Force translation function, the vertical\nposition and the horizontal position can be combined into positioning macros\nthat are easier to write than using the controls on the captioning control\npanel. Example: Tools/Realtime/Force Translation, {POS:13,3}{H:0,24},\nEnter. This can also be combined with macro variables in place of one or more\nof the numbers.\n1270 Eclipse Help\nYou can set up a show-specific job dictionary, including textreplacement\nposition codes, for each program you caption. For example, you\ncould set up {CMD1}={POS:1,2}{H:0,32}, {CMD2}={POS:13,3}{H:0,32},\netc.; and in the main dictionary you would have {CMD1}, {CMD2}, etc., to\nchange position, and macros defined as Ctrl+1, Ctrl+2 and Numeric Keypad\n1, Numeric keypad 2, that execute Force translation, {CMD1}, Enter. This\nfeature can be used to set up a captioner so that the keys they press and the\ndictionary entries they execute are always the same, but the specific positions\nwill change based on the entries in the position dictionary, and a showspecific\ndictionary can be set up without having to edit the macros and\ndictionary entries separately.\nSending script lines that reformat text on the fly\nIf you have told the captions to change to a new horizontal position, the\nrealtime captions will change. If you then switch to a script and begin sending\nscript lines, the script will follow the horizontal position that you have\nspecified for the realtime. The software will wait for you to hit the Send script\nline command (F12.) The moment you press that key, it will check, and if\nnecessary, reformat the current paragraph before sending the first line. The\nscript line won't actually reformat until you press the send command.\nOne exception to this is that the program will not reformat pop-on script\nparagraphs, including credits, because those are designed to go in a particular\nposition and should not change.\nCaption Appearance\nTo force a sequence of lowercase letters even though the output is set\nfor all case, use the {l1} and {l0} commands for lowercase on and lowercase\noff. There is also a lowercase toggle command {lT}. For example, a dictionary\nentry such as:\nM{l1}c{l0}Tavish\nwill be output as:\nMcTAVISH\n{A:attribute} â The same function that can be used to change attributes\nfor printing can be used to change attributes for closed captioning. The\n{A:under} and {A:italic} commands change to underscored characters or\nitalicized characters, and the {A:normal} changes back to normal text. The\n{A:bold} function, however, changes the captions to flashing.\nColor changes will take effect any time the FONT color is changed as\npart of a dictionary entry. In order to facilitate this easily, metadictionary\nentries for making color changes are a good idea and are included at the end\nof this section. Note that they also force the font to Courier New 13-point, but\nsince that's the default and since it doesn't really matter for captions, this\nwon't cause a problem.\nAccuCap: Dictionary Entries - Position and Appearance of Captions 1271\nThe color entries are: {WHITE}{BLACK}{RED}{GREEN}{YELLOW}\n{BLUE} {MAGENTA}\nNote that in order to implement many of these dictionary entries,\nadditions had to be made to the metadictionary. These new metadictionary\nentries are included in the accucap.set file.\nIn case you want to keep any modifications you have made to your\nmetadictionary and simply wish to make the changes yourself, here are the\nmetadictionary entries that are required to get the above captioning\ncommands to work:\n{L*}={/\"Left %/?PGH}\n{R*}={/\"Right %/?PGH}\n{P}={/\"Normal/?PGH}\n{BLANK}={/?CCB}\n{FLUSH}={/?CCF}\n{POS:*}={/\"%/?CCP}\n{l1}={/?LCO}\n{l0}={/?LCF}\n{lT}={/?LCT}\n{WHITE}={F:Courier New,13,400,0,CFFFFFF}\n{BLACK}={F:Courier New,13,400,0,C000000}\n{RED}={F:Courier New,13,400,0,C0000FF}\n{GREEN}={F:Courier New,13,400,0,C00FF00}\n{YELLOW}={F:Courier New,13,400,0,C00FFFF}\n{BLUE}={F:Courier New,13,400,0,CFF0000}\n{MAGENTA}={F:Courier New,13,400,0,CFF00FF}\n{CYAN}={F:Courier New,13,400,0,CFFFF00}\n1272 Eclipse Help\n29 AccuCap: Special characters\nSpecial characters\nAccuCap supports the complete set of extended foreign accent marks\navailable according to the new decoder standard. It also transmits the\nunaccented alternates for compatibility with older decoders.\nThese extended characters are accessible using the Edit/Insert/Special\ncharacter command (Ctrl+W.) Note that not all of the characters in the chart\nare supported by even the extended decoders.\nTo insert a musical note symbol in scripts and dictionary entries,\nsubstitute the paragraph symbol (Â¶) that will be converted to a musical note\non the closed captioning display (which does not support the paragraph\nsymbol.)

For a list of the new visualizers, go to\nSupport/Visualizer topics and press F2.\nOne of the most important changes this year is the number of reporters working\nremotely, mainly because of the Covid-19 Pandemic. There is a whole series of\nvisualizers to help you with setup and remote reporting.\nAudio Features - Multi-Channel Synchronized Recording and Playback has\nbeen expanded. Opus Compression Support is a new feature that provides high\nquality audio files with a reduced file size, better for sharing of audio files during\nteam editing. Visualizers . ASIO device support was added for multi-channel\naudio.\nConnection Magic is now fully integrated, with a number of enhancements\nthat make it easier for your clients and scopists to connect. In addition to using the\ninternet to connect with clients and scopists, you can use a local network, set up your\nPC to be a wifi hotspot with Connectify. With Version 10, Connectify is built in to\nEclipse, and when you turn on your computer, \"Eclipse services\" starts and puts an\nicon in your system tray. Another new feature in Connection Magic - Eclipse creates a\nsession link in your clipboard that you can paste into an email to your clients. When\nthey click the link, the session opens in Bridge Mobile, with no need to enter a session\nname or password. Visualizer.\nConnection status indicators appear in the upper right corner of your Eclipse\nscreen. Green lights indicate a working connection; red lights indicate a connection\nthat is not working, or is not being used.\n922\n659\n700\n921 663\n532\n115\n1276 Eclipse Help\nBoost - This feature, found under User settings/Translation/Translation\nMagic, sends your audio to Google Speech for help translating difficult vocabulary like\nunusual names or fast speaking, picking up words that may have been dropped, and\nsuggesting realtime auto-briefs. It can be used during Translation or Realtime but you\nwill need a good audio recording plus internet access. There are Visualizer movies on\nboth using, and setting up Boost. Visualizer for using Boost and Visualizer for setting\nup Boost.\nDelivery options for your transcript have been expanded.\nRealtime Statistics have been improved to provide better information about\nyour writing speed. Even after ending Realtime translation, you can mark a block, and\ngo to Tools/Job Report, and select Display: WPM graph to get a picture of your\nwriting speed. Visualizer.\nThe CART window will now show speakers' names in the colors you assign in\nthe Speaker List, if you have your CART window output set to Apply Edits.\nVisualizer\nDynamic Index locations mean that if you edit your document after indexing,\nand an item in the index has moved to a different page, the location reference in the\nindex is updated automatically. Visualizer.\nAnalyze documents has been enhanced. When Eclipse compares documents\nto your dictionary to suggest words that should be added for the upcoming job, the\nanalysis lists words in order of frequency, and now also lists how many occurrences\nthere were. Visualizer\nTouchscreens are now operational in Eclipse documents. You can use a Pinch to\nzoom in and out, a touch to scroll horizontally or vertically, a two-finger tap to open a\ncontext menu, or press and tap to mark a word and open a context menu.\nFor details on all changes in this version, go to the Support menu in Eclipse and\nselect New version changes.

What's New in Version 9\nWhat's New In Eclipse Version\n9\nCongratulations on upgrading to Eclipse version 9! This new version\nincludes a number of additions and improvements that help make your work\nfaster and more accurate. The visualizer (link at top left corner of page)\ndemonstrates many of the additions and enhancements. Below is a\ndescription of some of the new features, with links to pages with details and\nexamples.\nGoogle Translate support - You can now go to User\nsettings/Realtime/Output formats and use the \"Language\" setting to select\nany language in the dropdown list, and your output will be translated by\nGoogle Translate before it is transmitted. You will need internet access to use\nthis feature. Translating into different languages is not limited to\nBridgeMobile or Connection Magic. It can be used with many of Eclipse's\noutput formats, even those which use a serial connection. Also, foreign\nlanguage users can translate into English, or any language supported by\nGoogle Translate. When you use this feature, some settings such as Apply\nEdits and Flush Word Delay will need to be adjusted. For details on\ntranslating to different languages, see the Google Translate help page.\nCode Generator for QR (Quick Response) codes - You create a QR\n(Quick Response) code by using the Edit/Insert/Print command function\nand select Graphic as the command, and choose the QR Code URL option.\nType or paste the URL into the text box. For example, the QR code below will\ndirect you to the Advantage Software website.\n525\n525\n369\n1282 Eclipse Help\nYou can re-position and re-size the code image, and put it anywhere on\nthe page, including in the margin. You can use the codes to direct clients to\nopen BridgeMobile, to open a transcript or an audio or video file -- any URL\non the internet. New iPhones have QR code reading built into the camera\napp, and the latest version of Google Chrome for mobile devices has a QR\ncode reader built in. If you have one of these devices, you will not have to\ninstall a QR code reader app in order to use them. If using an older device,\nsimply install a QR reading app.\nWord Cloud Conflict Resolution - Eclipse can resolve many of the\nconflicts that happen as you write, but only on the basis of grammatical\nrules. This does not work for some conflicts, such as \\break\\brake,\n\\rifle\\rival, \\reflex\\reflection, \\paved\\paced, \\peer\\pier,\n\\principle\\principal - these conflicts need to be resolved based on the\nmeaning of the words. With Version 9, these conflicts can be resolved using\nWord Cloud Conflict Resolution. You do this by pre-programing these conflicts\nwith words that should appear with or near the words in question. Right-click\non a conflict dictionary entry, select Properties, then Advanced to go to the\nAI data. Check the \"Word cloud\" checkbox to change a conflict from a\ngrammar conflict to a meaning conflict. You will get a warning that checking\nor unchecking this box deletes all existing data for that conflict. Use the\nAdd/Modify/Delete buttons to add or remove individual words from the list\nthat Eclipse will then use to resolve the conflict.\nAutomated Proofreader and Auto-Magic Corrections - Under User\nsettings/Edit/Spell options there is now a Proofreader option. Turn that\non to allow automated proofreading.\nThe automated proofreading puts a light blue underscore under any\npiece of text it perceives as a possible error. Placing the cursor on the\nunderscored text will show the specific error in the status bar and also above\nthe AutoMagic choices. It can find everything from missing punctuation and\nnon-matched open/close quotes/parens to suspicious grammar such as \"were\ntalk.\"\nYou can ignore a proofreading error by hitting the Escape key with the\ncursor anywhere in the highlighted area. (Note that the \"watchwords\"\nspecialty marks are automatically cleared as you pass the cursor by them,\nsince they're not technically errors.)\nYou can scan to proofreading marks by using the\nMove/Scan/Any/Proofreading highlights function, though the most\nefficient way to use it is simply to review the marks in place as you edit.\nOther enhancements and improvements have been made in the\nareas of Editing, Translating, Production and working with Dictionaries, as\nwell as administration and interfacing. Some highlights:\n166\n414\n1284\nFeatures added in prior versions 1283\nÂ· Multi-channel audio recording has been enhanced with the addition\nof rewind and fast-forward buttons; automatic merging of audio files\n(eg. morning and afternoon sessions); automatic conversion of mp3\nfiles to a playable format like wav; simplified synchronization of audio\nfrom an external drive like a digital recorder or steno machine.\nÂ· Audio Redaction allows you to select a section of audio to be\nredacted at the same time as you redact the text. Using the Redact\nAudio dialog, you can fine tune your selection to the exact part of the\naudio you need to redact.\nÂ· CART window can \"apply edits\" showing the correction on your\nEclipse screen, and CART clients will see the correction instantly\nÂ· Bridge Mobile can now have persistent session names, which can\nspan multi-day proceedings, and Bridge Mobile will automatically\nopen the current document for your continuing session.\nFor details on all changes in this version, go to the Support menu in\nEclipse and select New version changes.

This new version\nincludes a number of additions and improvements that help make your work\nfaster and more accurate. The visualizer (link at top left corner of page)\ndemonstrates many of the additions and enhancements. Below is an outline\nof the new features, with links to pages with details and examples.\nBecause of a change in the way Eclipse connect to the Connection Magic\nserver, it can now be used anywhere you have internet access, so you can\nuse a keyless license, the Team Editing feature, and the Bridge Broadcaster\nover the Internet anywhere. You no longer have to have port 4020\nunblocked.\nA number of changes make it easier to connect and use Bridge Mobile\nand Team Editing: the use of \"rooms\" for sessions, so you can choose\nfrom a much shorter list; the ability to hand off host status to another\neditor; a red background will alert a scopist to a section of the transcript\nthat has been changed and is not yet reconciled with the reporter's version;\nimprovements in the refresh process in Bridge, and many others, detailed in\nthe New Version Changes file.\nThe popular Auto-brief feature has several enhancements: theory\nhints are now in a separate category, making it easier for you to use them\nto improve your steno theory and enable you to write shorter words in\ngeneral; there is a new category of \"Used briefs\" , shown in reverse\norder, so as you use them, they will scroll off the list; you can get\nsuggestions during editing , and not just during realtime; new\nmetadictionary entries: {ABSTENO} or {ABMODIFY} to change the steno of\nthe last entry in the auto-brief list, or {ABMODIFY} to change a specific\nsuggestion.\nOther enhancements and improvements have been made in the\nareas of Editing, Translating, Production and working with Dictionaries, as\nwell as administration and interfacing.

7\nFeatures Introduced In Eclipse\nVersion 7\nCongratulations on upgrading to Eclipse version 7! This new version includes a\nnumber of additions and improvements that help make your work faster and more\naccurate. The visualizer (link at top left corner of page) demonstrates many of the\nadditions and enhancements. Below is an outline of the new features, with links to\npages with details and examples.\nPDF Output\nThere is a new Output to PDF menu item on the Production menu, right under\nthe Output to ASCII function. It will automatically detect your index items, lets you\nembed exhibit files, and include signatures.\nMulti-page design including 5 preset styles\nA multi-page transcript is a printed transcript that contains four pages on one\npiece of paper. A multi-page transcript is also known as a compressed transcript, or a\nfour-in-one transcript. In order to make it easier to set up, the multi-page dialog\noffers five styles, labeled \"Style 1, Style 2 ...\" in the drop-list at the top of the multipage\ndialog. Select a style and hit the \"View sample\" button to see a sample of a\ntranscript creating using the selected style. For example, Style 1 looks like this:\n632\n610\nFeatures added in prior versions 1291\nIf you wish to use that style, hit the \"Select\" button and all of the multi-page\nsettings will be changed so that your multi-page printout will look like the sample. If\nyou wish to customize from there, it will be much easier to start with a pre-defined\nstyle and tweak a few items than to start from scratch and try to set everything\nmanually.\nTranscript Delivery system that integrates\nPrint/PDF/ASCII/E-mail/etc. into one step\nAt the bottom of the Production menu, under the Print/ASCII functions, is a new\nmenu item titled \"Delivery.\" As you can see from the dialog, it offer many ways to\ndeliver your transcripts, including bundling into one zip file, which can be emailed to\nyour client.\n625\n1292 Eclipse Help\nMulti-channel audio Recording\nEclipse can record and play back multiple (up to 8) separate channels of audio\nwithout using any special hardware or file formats. In fact, it is possible to make\nmultiple recordings from the same device source; so if you want to record highquality\n(for yourself) and low-quality (to stream to a scopist), you can create two\nchannels with the same device input but different compression selections. You might\nmake a compressed sound file to stream over the internet to a remote scopist, while\nrecording a higher quality, larger sound file for the reporter to use on her computer.\nIn addition, if you use multiple microphones and multiple recording devices to\nisolate different parts of a large room, you can use the Seating Chart to let Eclipse\nknow where each speaker/microphone is located, and then hitting the play button will\nalways play the audio from the microphone closest to the person who was speaking\n(as indicated by the cursor position).\n659\nFeatures added in prior versions 1293\nAutoblock\nWith Autoblock, Eclipse can automatically detect when you are writing or\ndictating standardized text such as jury instructions. As soon as Eclipse detects the\nfirst few words of one of your Autoblocks, it will appear in a popup and you can insert\nthe remainder of the text with one steno stroke or voice command. Details on setup\nand use of Autoblock are in the AUTOBLOCK help page .\nEdit Box Shortcuts with Google Integration\nA new button has been added at the right edge of most edit (text) boxes, listing\nadditional shortcuts. In the Global dialog, in addition to the Special entries dropdown\nlisting of shortcuts, there is a listing of many more shortcuts accessed using the\nnew button. In this example, we can see shortcuts to adjust the dialog display.\n517\n517\n63\n1294 Eclipse Help\nAlso in this dialog you can see that F5, which normally opens the Find dialog,\nwill \"Google it\" when you are in an edit box. This will open your default browser and\ndisplay the results of a Google search.\nThere are other places in Eclipse where you can \"Google it\"\nÂ· if you click the Definition button during a spellcheck, there is a \"Google it\"\nbutton on the View definition dialog\nÂ· if you mark a piece of text while editing, one of the auto-magic choices is to\nGoogle it.\nConnection Magic Session Controls\nConnection Magic has new features and expanded usability. There are new\nsession controls that allow you to Color code people in the session (so, for example,\nyou can easily see where your scopists are in the transcript); Find the location of your\nco-editor; send a Private message to an individual in the session, Remove someone\nfrom the session if necessary, and ask Eclipse to remind you of the session\nPassword.\nUsing Bridge Mobile Pro with Cloud storage for proofreading your\nEclipse documents.\nYou can convert a finished translation to a file that can be opened in Bridge\nMobile on another device, and after proofreading, your can bring it back to Eclipse\nwith your proofreading comments right in the document. This makes it easy to\nproofread your transcripts on a mobile device for proofreading on the go.\n532\n417\nFeatures added in prior versions 1295\nBridge Mobile Pro with expanded capabilities\nNote that Bridge Mobile consists of two components: Bridge Broadcaster for\nreporters, and the Bridge Mobile Viewer for attorneys. The Bridge Broadcaster lets you\nstream realtime to unlimited clients locally and in the Cloud for one low price. The\nstandard Bridge Mobile Viewer for your clients is free. Bridge Mobile Pro is available to\nattorneys an others who want the additional capabilities.\nAdditional features in Bridge Mobile Pro include:\nÂ· the ability to export data, including exports to Bridge for PC, storage in the\nCloud, emailing to yourself or another verified email address\nÂ· advanced searches\nÂ· 23 color-coded issue codes\nÂ· supports notes\nÂ· can create a hyperlinked realtime index\nYou can download both the free and pro versions of Bridge Mobile in Apple's App\nStore, the Google Play Store, and the Amazon App Store free of charge by searching\nfor \"Bridge Mobile.\" You can upgrade to the Pro version at any time.\nEnhancements to existing features\nEnhancements to Auto-Brief\nVersion 7 makes the popular Auto-Brief feature even more useful with a number\nof enchancements:\nÂ· You can specify the maximum number of words that the auto-brief feature will\ninclude in a suggestion. (By default, the auto-brief feature will scan for\nphrases up to five words long containing words not on the ineligible words list.\nSome users felt that even five words is too many for a brief and wanted to dial\nthat down, so now they can choose a different number.)\nÂ· If you change the background color of Auto-briefs in User\nsettings/Display/Color selections, it will change the background color of\nthe auto-brief window.\nÂ· If you have your auto-brief window set up to display on a second screen, you\nmay want to set the new Max Width setting in the User\nsettings/Realtime/Auto-brief settings dialog to the width of your second\nscreen. The briefs will then automatically wrap to that size and won't run off\nthe screen.\nÂ· Buttons that open the Ineligible Words and Theory Settings dialogs, so you\ncan easily access and modify those items.\nÂ· Option to change how many times Auto-brief sees a word or phrase written\nbefore it suggests a brief. The default is 2, but you can ask it to wait until the\n3rd or 4th (or whatever) time you write it, unless you specifically request a\nbrief earlier.\n1207\n500\n1296 Eclipse Help\nÂ· Right-clicking on an Auto-brief gives you the option of rejecting the brief,\nasking for a new one, or opening the auto-brief dictionary.\nÂ· Auto-brief will automatically detect if you request a brief for a plural word, and\nit will give you a brief for the singular, on the assumption that you can easily\nadd plural suffix if you wish.\nÂ· A new feature, {ABDELETE}, will remove any brief from your auto-brief\ndictionary and the auto-brief window. Simply hit {ABDELETE}, followed by the\nbrief you want removed, and it will be deleted.\nÂ· Another new function, {ABSELECT} prompts you for the stroke for a brief you\nwish to use, and will move that brief to the \"requested\" list, so it will be\navailable for use immediately.\nÂ· {ABCHANGE} will prompt you for the steno stroke for a specific auto-brief that\nyou want a new steno suggestion for.\nConflict A-I Sharing\nOften, you will have many different stylistic conflicts that should follow exactly\nthe same grammatical rules.\nFor example, if you have conflicts for \\page\\Page{#N} and \\volume\\Vol.{#R}\nand \\exhibit\\Exhibit{#N}, those are all pretty much the same in terms of grammar\nrules.\nThe same goes for conflicts such as \\yes\\{,?}yes{,?} and \\no\\{,?}no{,?} and\nany others that may have different content but identical grammatical contexts.\nFor these items, it is possible to link those conflicts together to share AI data,\nand work by the same set of rules. For details on how to do this, see the Conflict A-I\nSharing help page. The end result will be that these conflicts will all learn much\nfaster and become more accurate more quickly. They will be more consistent, because\nthey are not each learning separate rules and are instead sharing a single set of rules.\nNew design for File dialogs\nAs of Version 7, Eclipse has a customized file dialog, simplifying the process of\nopening and writing files.\nWhen you select File/Open notes, for example, the Open File dialog opens,\nlisting just the Note files and subfolders in your Job folder.\n171\n171\n59\nFeatures added in prior versions 1297\nYou will see that the keyboard focus is in the filename box, so that you can\nimmediately type letters or select with arrows to find the file you want, then hit Enter\nor OK to open the file.\nÂ· Selecting a file from the list will fill in the name box.\nÂ· Typing a name in the name box will sort for the files in the list that match, or\nno file at all if no files match. This allows you to easily cross-check for\naccidentally typing a new name that matches an existing file.\nÂ· Clicking on another folder in the left-hand pane will list the note files in that\nlocation.\nThe display is customizable. For directions on how to customize your display,\nand other features of the new design, see the File Dialogs help page.\nVersion 7 contains many additional features, including enhancements to the File\nManager, and in the Captioning and Speech versions of Eclipse. For details on all\nchanges in this version, go to the Support menu in Eclipse and select New version\nchanges. A pdf file will open, describing all the changes in Version 7.\n31.5 Features added in Version 6\nFeatures Introduced In Eclipse Version 6\n59\n1298 Eclipse Help\nEclipse version 6 includeed a number of additions and improvements\nthat help make your work faster and more accurate.\nKeyless license\nThe feature you've been waiting for ! The new Keyless license\noffers an alternative to the use of a hardware key. Easily installed on multiple\ncomputers, so you can leave your laptop on during a break, work at your\ndesktop, and go back to work in court, as Eclipse automatically suspends the\ncomputer you aren't currently using. Work with or without an internet\nconnection.\nConnection Magic\nConnection Magic makes it possible for any number of Eclipse users to\nedit the same document at the same time. You can use Connection Magic\nwhen you are translating a file, doing Realtime or Tran and Edit, or while\nediting after translating. A collaborative editing session is much more\npowerful than the StenoLink feature. It sends any and all edits across the\ncommunications system so that everyone in the session will see everyone's\nwork. The documents stay perfectly synchronized. In the event of any\nsynchronization problems, all of the documents will be made to match the\nmaster document being shared.\nEach person editing the document will see, in addition to their own\ncursor, a cursor for each other user editing the document. These other\ncursors will have flags telling you who is editing in that location.\nIf any user performs a global of any kind, the collaborative editing\nsession will reflect the edits, and the global itself will be entered into the\nappropriate dictionary on the other systems. In other words, if one user\nmakes a global and puts it into a job dictionary, it will be entered into the job\ndictionary for that job on all of the computers in the editing session.\nIf any user in the collaborative editing session wants to send a message\nto the other users in the session, they can select Tools/Connection\nMagic/Send message. Type a message and hit [enter] and the other users\nwill see it in the infobar or in the connections dialog.\nTranslation Magic enhancements\nThere are new controls for Translation Magic so you can get exactly what\nyou want:\nÂ· \"Overall replacements\" to limit or expand replacements\nÂ· \"Misstrokes replacements\" to determine how likely TM is to prefer\nmisstrokes to phonetics\nÂ· \"Phonetics replacements\" to determine how likely TM is to prefer phonetics\nto misstrokes\nÂ· \"Test steno\" - you can enter steno and see how TM will render it\n37 37\n532\n278\nFeatures added in prior versions 1299\nDictionary enhancements\nÂ· Dictionary analysis tool: Reports words that are not in your main dictionary,\nor any dictionary. Also reports all of the conflicts between the selected\ndictionaries, including any conflict between them or between one of them\nand your main dictionary.\nÂ· When you double-click an entry to view its properties, it includes the\ndefinition of the word\nÂ· When searching for steno, you can find it faster with steno emulation\nSpelling dictionaries include a new location for shared\ndictionaries - \"SPELL\"\nAdding \"SPELL=[foldername]\" to User settings/Programming/File\nlocations for several users, specifies one location for a spelling dictionary for\nall the users\nAuto-Brief enhancements\nEclipse version 6 includes a number of enhancement to the Auto-brief\nfeature.\nÂ· In the Auto-brief settings dialog, you will see an option to Use\nKislingbury suggestions, which gives you access to over 90,000 briefs\ncreated by Mark Kislingbury.\n134\n383\n500\n1300 Eclipse Help\nÂ· You can create your own briefs dictionary, and Auto-brief will use it to make\nsuggestions\nÂ· Auto-brief counts how many times it has reminded you of an entry, and\nrecords that information in a REMIND.DIX dictionary.\nÂ· If you mark text while working in realtime, AutoMagic will show a brief for\nthe marked text.\nFor details, see the Auto-brief help files , and the related\nVisualizers.\nFeature expansions\nÂ· Support for Extended keyboards on writers includes the ability to\ncustomize every key, including the split keys on the Passport writer.\nÂ· After moving through a document doing a scan or find, AutoMagic will put\nthe \"Last edit point\" command as the top choice\nÂ· The Tools/Statistics function has been replaced by the Tools/Job\nreport . This report shows a complete list of all print commands in the\ndocument, including comment lines left by a scopist or proofreader. You\ncan select any item on the list to jump immediately to that spot in the\ntranscript.\nÂ· Typeover tracking memorizes the last three replacements and all three\nchoices will appear for you to select with a single keystroke.\nÂ· There are new CART window settings, including \"always top window.\"\nÂ· New Division Interval controls create a \"division overlap\" between\ndownloaded sections of a document.\nÂ· New Translate controls for digits allow you to choose whether number\nbar entries should be dictionary-based or automatic.\nÂ· Expanded concordance index controls, including a job-specific\ncommon words list, for words to be excluded from the current job only.\nÂ· When automatic indexing, \"Insert index item\" can use autoreplacements,\nCtrl+D to open the time/date dialog, Ctrl+K to change capitalization, and\nother controls used in other editing fields.\nÂ· Automatic exhibit lettering (previous versions offered automatic\nnumbering only)\nÂ· Dynamic zoom levels: If you select any one of the page width, page length\nor text width zoom levels in the display , the display will dynamically\nchange to keep that selected element visible no matter what the window\nsize.\nFor a complete list of all changes made to Eclipse, select New Version\nChanges from the Eclipse Support menu.\n31.6 Features added in Version 5\nFeatures Introduced In Eclipse Version 5\n500\n932\n1003\n884\n942\n496\n244\n605\n551\n122\nFeatures added in prior versions 1301\nCongratulations on upgrading to Eclipse version 5!

Each time you global\nan untranslate, an unobtrusive list of numbered suggestions will display. Press the\nnumber key that corresponds to the desired word, and the global will be added to\nyour job and dictionary. The more you use global magic, the better it becomes at\noffering suggestions!\nUnglobal: Eclipse keeps track of all the steno globals youâve made, and lets you\nundo globals at your leisure. Undoing a global will remove it from both the\ntranscript and your dictionary.\n506\n336\n326\n338\n1304 Eclipse Help\nUSB writers supported: Eclipse supports all writers that communicate directly\nvia USB, for both realtime and reading notes . You will need to go to the Input\nTab and set Realtime From and/or Read Notes From to \"USB port.\"\nEclipse StenoLink: Reporter and scopist can link their systems through the\ninternet or a local network , and translate the same job simultaneously! Any\nglobals made by the scopist will be communicated directly back to the reporter's\ncomputer, exactly as if the changes had been made on the reporter's computer.\nSpeaker List: The Speaker List has been made more user-friendly. The\nspeaker button on the Translate Tab and the F2 speaker box now both utilize the\nsame dialog. Improvements include the ability to customize speed keys, colors, and\nassign speakers to groups. The new Speaker List also automates getting speaker\nnames to/from job dictionaries.\nMulti-page printing: The multi-page printing dialog has been greatly\nsimplified. New font choices, new options for page-ordering, and easier\nheaders/footers are just a few of the improvements here.\nMultimedia control panel: The Multimedia Control Panel consolidates\nseveral different controls into one easy-to-use dialog. It also allows you to adjust\nvolume and speed settings during recording.\nTranslation Magic: Working with Global Magic, Translation Magic applies\nIntelligent phonetics and Dragged/Dropped Key rescue to multiple steno strokes. With\nTranslation Magic turned on, if you highlight steno for a global replacement, Eclipse\nwill figure out what you mean, and will use Global Magic to suggest words not yet in\nyour dictionary.\nAuto-Brief: During a Realtime translation, Auto-Brief will offer you a steno\nshortcut for a word or phrase that keeps occurring. With Auto-brief turned on, the\nsecond time you write an unusual word or term or phrase that takes at least 3 steno\nstrokes, Eclipse will suggest a shortcut that is ready to use. You can be sure the\nshortcut will not conflict with any entries in any of the dictionaries you are using, and\nas soon as you use it, it will be added to your job dictionary.\nRedacted text: To allow you to hide sensitive material like names and\naddresses, Eclipse offers 2 levels of Redacted Text . At the first level, you can hide\ntext on the display, by setting the Display colors in User settings/Display/Color\nselections/Redacted text so that the information in the redacted text will be\nprotected on your screen. At the second level, you can go to User\nsettings/Document/Advanced and select Hide redacted text. When Hide\nredacted text is on, all redacted text will be eliminated from the printout, PDF, ASCII\nand Bridge exports. If you turn this option off, redacted text will appear as normal.\nEach individual document will remember this setting separately. You can use\ndictionary entries in the form {R:hiddentext} to redact text.\nReady for VISTA: Elcipse is ready to run on the VISTA operating system.\nHowever, VISTA does hide the icons in the upper right corner of Eclipse dialogs that\nlet you adjust the display options. Eclipse offers an alternative way to adjust the\ndialog boxes' zoom, anchor, transparency, and the Less/More option. If you click the\nicon in the uppper left corner, or hit Alt+Spacebar, and choose Customize, a dialog\nwill open that lets you set the display options for that dialog.\n483 230\n226\n527\n249\n244\n610\n1033\n278\n500\n1044\nFeatures added in prior versions 1305\nSpeaker Seating Chart: A check-box on the Speaker List allows you to open a\nSeating Chart of all the speakers listed.\nYou can open it from the speaker dialog that appears at the beginning of a\ntranslation for you to fill in speaker names.\nYou can also turn the Seating chart on and off using the Window menu/View\nToggles (Ctrl+Shift+F3).\nThe seating chart dialog can be moved, resized, anchored, zoomed (to make the\nfonts bigger or smaller) and made more transparent.\nFor details on the Seating Chart, see the help file and the Speaker Seating\nChart Visualizer.\nThe CART Window:There is a new output type among those listed under Output\nformat: (Bridge/Closed captioning/etc.), called \"CART window.\" If you select CART\nwindow, when you start realtime you'll get a separate window that will open up below\nEclipse.\nThe CART window is independent from the Eclipse window and can be moved to a\nseparate screen. If you set up your external port as a dual-screen instead of a clone,\nthen you can drag the CART window over to the external screen, and you will be able\nto use all of Eclipse on your laptop screen, including the steno, the auto-brief window,\nthe toolbars, etc., and the CART audience will only see is the CART window.\n261\n1306 Eclipse Help\nFor details on the CART Window, see the help file and the CART Window\nVisualizer.\nEnhancements to the Auto-Brief feature: Eclipse version 4.3 includes a\nnumber of enhancement to the Auto-brief feature. They include:\nÂ· Dictionary codes to reject the last brief, and an option to suggest a new one\nÂ· Auto-brief will remind you about existing briefs\nÂ· An option always to suggest double strokes\nÂ· Movable and resizable window\nÂ· Inelligible words listed in User settings/Programming tab\nÂ· Auto-brief can supply steno from a pre-defined list, also found in the User\nsettings/Programming tab\nFor details on using these and other features of Auto-brief, see the Auto-brief\nhelp file, the Auto-brief ineligible words help file, the Auto-brief steno\ntheory help file, and related Visualizers.\nFor a complete list of all changes made to Eclipse, select New Version Changes\nfrom the Eclipse Support menu.\n942\n500\n828\n829\nIndex 1307\nÂ© 2023 by Advantage Software,
